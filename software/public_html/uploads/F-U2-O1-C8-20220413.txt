J	Freedman, BI; Skorecki, K				Freedman, Barry I.; Skorecki, Karl			Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions in Apolipoprotein L1 Gene-Associated Nephropathy	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Review							CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; HIV-ASSOCIATED NEPHROPATHY; APOL1 RISK VARIANTS; FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS; JC POLYOMA-VIRUS; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; NONDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY; DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY; LUPUS NEPHRITIS	Molecular genetics have revolutionized the understanding of susceptibility to the broad spectrum of kidney diseases with light microscopic appearance of FSGS, particularly in populations with recent African ancestry. These disorders include idiopathic FSGS, HIV-associated nephropathy, severe lupus nephritis, sickle cell nephropathy, and the primary kidney disorder focal global glomerulosclerosis, which had historically been ascribed to systemic hypertension. FSGS was once thought to include a multitude of unrelated disorders with similar histologic appearance. However, variation in the apolipoprotein L1 gene locus is now known to account for the vast majority of such cases in African Americans as well as nearly all the excess risk for FSGS and related forms of progressive nondiabetic nephropathy in populations with recent African ancestry, relative to European ancestry. Inheriting two coding apolipoprotein 1:1 gene nephropathy risk variants is necessary for susceptibility to CKD; however, these variants alone are insufficient to produce disease. This work reviews the evidence supporting second hits or modifying factors that affect risk for apolipoprotein 1:1 gene-associated nephropathy and produce the protean manifestations of this common and complex syndrome. Targeting modifiable second factors will lead to preventive therapies for slowing progression of nondiabetic nephropathy in many patients possessing two apolipoprotein 1:11 gene risk variants. This model of genetic risk coupled with modifiable second hits will serve as a paradigm applicable to patients with CKD of various etiologies as well as a host of other complex disorders.

The role of genetic factors in clinical practice is not clearly defined. The relevance of genetic variants to disease pathogenesis is still uncertain because of not characterized gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We examined the predictive value of combining the 133 UC risk loci with genetic interactions in an ongoing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS. The Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) IBD GWAS was used as a replication cohort. We applied logic regression (LR), a novel adaptive regression methodology, to search for high-order interactions. Exploratory genotype correlations with UC sub-phenotypes [extent of disease, need of surgery, age of onset, extra-intestinal manifestations and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)] were conducted. The combination of 133 UC loci yielded good UC risk predictability [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86]. A higher cumulative allele score predicted higher UC risk. Through LR, several lines of evidence for genetic interactions were identified and successfully replicated in the WTCCC cohort. The genetic interactions combined with the gene-smoking interaction significantly improved predictability in the model (AUC, from 0.86 to 0.89, P = 3.26E-05). Explained UC variance increased from 37 to 42 % after adding the interaction terms. A within case analysis found suggested genetic association with PSC. Our study demonstrates that the LR methodology allows the identification and replication of high-order genetic interactions in UC GWAS datasets. UC risk can be predicted by a 133 loci and improved by adding gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.

Some MCP gene variants implicate in asthma and monoclonal antibody for MCP-3 blocks allergic inflammations in the patients with asthma. Detection of interactions between gene and environment or between genes for complex disease such as asthma is important. We searched for an evidence of genetic effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MCP genes as well as gene gene interactions involved in asthma. Methods: Four hundreds asthmatics and four hundreds normal controls were enrolled. Asthma was defined as a positive bronchodilator response or positive methacholine provocation test with compatible clinical symptoms. Seven MCP gene SNPs (2 SNPs in MCP-1, 1 in MCP-2, and 4 in MCP-3) were included. Association analyses between SNP and asthma, and the tests for gene gene interaction were performed. Results: Strong linkage disequilibria were found among 7 MCP gene polymorphisms. There was no SNP that showed a significant association with asthma among 7 SNPs of 3 MCP genes. No haplotype was associated with asthma, either. The combination of MCP1-25186>A, MCP2+46A>C, and MCP3+563C>T was the best predictive model for asthma as compared to the control in tests for gene gene interaction. The MCP1-2518G>A and MCP2+46A>C was the second best predictive combination and this had the highest synergistic interaction effect on the subject's status than any other combination of polymorphisms. Complete linkages were not associated with the gene gene interactions models. Conclusions: MCP gene polymorphisms probably interact with each other; thus, these findings may help in developing a possible genetic marker to predict asthma.

The biggest challenge to overcome cancer is to identify driver genes that promote the cancer development from a huge amount of passenger mutations that have no effect on the selective growth advantage of cancer. In order to solve those problems, some researchers have started to focus on identification of driver genes by integrating networks with other biological information. However, more efforts should be needed to improve the prediction performance. Methods: Considering the facts that driver genes have impact on expression of their downstream genes, they likely interact with each other to form functional modules and those modules should tend to be expressed similarly in the same tissue. We proposed a novel model named by DyTidriver to identify driver genes through involving the gene dysregulated expression, tissue-specific expression and variation frequency into the human functional interaction network (e.g. human FIN). Results: This method was applied on 974 breast, 316 prostate and 230 lung cancer patients. The consequence shows our method outperformed other five existing methods in terms of Fscore, Precision and Recall values. The enrichment and cociter analysis illustrate DyTidriver can not only identifies the driver genes enriched in some significant pathways but also has the capability to figure out some unknown driver genes. Conclusion: The final results imply that driver genes are those that impact more dysregulated genes and express similarly in the same tissue.

To analyze this high volume gene-expression data, one such powerful tool is Clustering. For any clustering algorithm, its efficiency majorly depends upon the underlying similarity/dissimilarity measure. During the analysis of such data often there is a need to further explore the similarity of genes not only with respect to their expression values but also with respect to their functional annotations, which can be obtained from Gene Ontology (GO) databases. In the existing literature, several novel clustering and bi-clustering approaches were proposed to identify co-regulated genes from gene-expression datasets. Identifying co-regulated genes from gene expression data misses some important biological information about functionalities of genes, which is necessary to identify semantically related genes. In this paper, we have proposed sixteen different semantic gene-gene dissimilarity measures utilizing biological information of genes retrieved from a global biological database namely Gene Ontology (GO). Four proximity measures, viz. Euclidean, Cosine, point symmetry and line symmetry are utilized along with four different representations of gene-GO-term annotation vectors to develop total sixteen gene-gene dissimilarity measures. In order to illustrate the profitability of developed dissimilarity measures, some multi-objective as well as single-objective clustering algorithms are applied utilizing proposed measures to identify functionally similar genes from Mouse genome and Yeast datasets. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of our proposed sixteen dissimilarity measures with three existing state-of-the-art semantic similarity and distance measures.

BIOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Gene concepts; Regulatory genes; MicroRNAs; Pseudogenes; Transcript function	MICRORNA; RNAS; EXPRESSION	Although much has been learned about hereditary mechanisms since Gregor Mendel's famous experiments, gene concepts have always remained vague, notwithstanding their central role in biology. During over hundred years of genetic research, gene concepts have often and dynamically changed to accommodate novel experimental findings, without ever providing a generally accepted definition of the 'gene.' Yet, the distinction between 'regulatory genes' and 'structural genes' has remained a common theme in modern gene concepts since the definition of the operon-model. This distinction is now challenged by recent findings which suggest that, at least in eukaryotes, structural genes may in many situations have a regulatory function that is independent of the function of the gene product (protein or non-coding RNA molecule). This brief paper discusses these new findings and some possible implications for the notion of the 'regulatory gene.'.

Therefore tissue specificity is important in identifying disease-gene associations. Hence this paper seeks to discuss the impact of using tissue specificity in predicting new disease-gene associations and how to use tissue specificity along with phenotype information for a particular disease. Methods: In order to find out the impact of using tissue specificity for predicting new disease-gene associations, this study proposes a novel method called tissue-specified genes to construct tissues-specific gene-gene networks for different tissue samples. Subsequently, these networks are used with phenotype details to predict disease genes by using Katz method. The proposed method was compared with three other tissue-specific network construction methods in order to check its effectiveness. Furthermore, to check the possibility of using tissue-specific gene-gene network instead of generic protein-protein network at all time, the results are compared with three other methods. Results: In terms of leave-one-out cross validation, calculation of the mean enrichment and ROC curves indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing network construction methods. Furthermore tissues-specific gene-gene networks make a more positive impact on predicting disease-gene associations than generic protein-protein interaction networks. Conclusions: In conclusion by integrating tissue-specific data it enabled prediction of known and unknown disease-gene associations for a particular disease more effectively. Hence it is better to use tissue-specific gene-gene network whenever possible. In addition the proposed method is a better way of constructing tissue-specific gene-gene networks.

J	Gomez-Vela, F; Diaz-Diaz, N				Gomez-Vela, Francisco; Diaz-Diaz, Norberto			Gene Network Biological Validity Based on Gene-Gene Interaction Relevance	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							EXPRESSION DATA; GENOMIC DATA; CELL-CYCLE; SCALE-FREE; INFERENCE; YEAST; LIMITATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; SEARCH; MODELS	In recent years, gene networks have become one of the most useful tools for modeling biological processes. Many inference gene network algorithms have been developed as techniques for extracting knowledge from gene expression data. Ensuring the reliability of the inferred gene relationships is a crucial task in any study in order to prove that the algorithms used are precise. Usually, this validation process can be carried out using prior biological knowledge. The metabolic pathways stored in KEGG are one of the most widely used knowledgeable sources for analyzing relationships between genes. This paper introduces a new methodology, GeneNetVal, to assess the biological validity of gene networks based on the relevance of the gene-gene interactions stored in KEGG metabolic pathways. Hence, a complete KEGG pathway conversion into a gene association network and a new matching distance based on gene-gene interaction relevance are proposed. The performance of GeneNetVal was established with three different experiments. Firstly, our proposal is tested in a comparative ROC analysis. Secondly, a randomness study is presented to show the behavior of GeneNetVal when the noise is increased in the input network. Finally, the ability of GeneNetVal to detect biological functionality of the network is shown.

A major statistical challenge is how to deal with a large number of parameters measuring possible interaction effects, which leads to reduced power of any statistical test due to a large number of degrees of freedom or high cost of adjustment for multiple testing. Hence, a popular idea is to first apply some dimension reduction techniques before testing, while another is to apply only statistical tests that are developed for and robust to high-dimensional data. To combine both ideas, we propose applying an adaptive sum of squared score (SSU) test and several other adaptive tests. These adaptive tests are extensions of the adaptive Neyman test [ Fan, 1996], which was originally proposed for high-dimensional data, providing a simple and effective way for dimension reduction. On the other hand, the original SSU test coincides with a version of a test specifically developed for high-dimensional data. We apply these adaptive tests and their original nonadaptive versions to simulated data to detect interactions between two groups of SNPs (e. g. multiple SNPs in two candidate regions). We found that for sparse models (i.e. with only few non-zero interaction parameters), the adaptive SSU test and its close variant, an adaptive version of the weighted sum of squared score (SSUw) test, improved the power over their non-adaptive versions, and performed consistently well across various scenarios. The proposed adaptive tests are built in the general framework of regression analysis, and can thus be applied to various types of traits in the presence of covariates. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

In this work, we propose a new similarity-based test to assess GxG at the gene level, which permits the study of epistasis at biologically functional units with amplified interaction signals. Methods: Under the framework of genetrait similarity regression (SimReg), we propose a gene-based test for detecting GxG. SimReg uses a regression model to correlate trait similarity with genotypic similarity across a gene. Unlike existing gene-level methods based on leading principal components (PCs), SimReg summarizes all information on genotypic variation within a gene and can be used to assess the joint/interactive effects of two genes as well as the effect of one gene conditional on another. Results: Using simulations and a real data application to the Warfarin study, we show that the SimReg GxG tests have satisfactory power and robustness under different genetic architecture when compared to existing gene-based interaction tests such as PC analysis or partial least squares. A genome-wide association study with approx. 20,000 genes may be completed on a parallel computing system in 2 weeks. (C) 2014 S.

Studies over the last year have highlighted more and more polymorphisms, pathways and interactions responsible for metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease, obesity and dyslipidemia. Recent findings Many of these chronic illnesses can be partially blamed by altered lipid metabolism, combined with individual genetic components. Critical evaluation and comparison of these recent studies is essential in order to comprehend the results, conclusions and future prospects in the field of genomics as a whole. Recent literature elucidates significant gene-diet and gene-environment interactions resulting in altered lipid metabolism, inflammation and other metabolic imbalances leading to cardiovascular disease and obesity. Summary Epigenetic and epistatic interactions are now becoming more significantly associated with such disorders, as genomic research digs deeper into the complex nature of genetic individuality and heritability. The vast array of data collected from genome-wide association studies must now be empowered and explored through more complex interaction studies, using standardized methods and larger sample sizes. In doing so the etiology of chronic disease progression will be further understood.

Because multifactoriality is expected to play a pivotal role, many studies are currently focused on collecting information on the genetic and environmental factors that potentially influence these diseases. However, there is still a lack of efficient and thoroughly tested statistical models that can be used to identify implicated features and their interactions. Simulations using large biologically realistic data sets with known gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that influence the risk of a complex disease are a convenient and useful way to assess the performance of statistical methods. Results: The Gene-Environment iNteraction Simulator 2 (GENS2) simulates interactions among two genetic and one environmental factor and also allows for epistatic interactions. GENS2 is based on data with realistic patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and imposes no limitations either on the number of individuals to be simulated or on number of non-predisposing genetic/environmental factors to be considered. The GENS2 tool is able to simulate gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. To make the Simulator more intuitive, the input parameters are expressed as standard epidemiological quantities. GENS2 is written in Python language and takes advantage of operators and modules provided by the simuPOP simulation environment. It can be used through a graphical or a command-line interface and is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gensim. The software is released under the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Conclusions: Data produced by GENS2 can be used as a benchmark for evaluating statistical tools designed for the identification of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.

As part of sequence variation, gene-gene interaction has been ubiquitously observed in nature, where its role in shaping the development of an organism has been broadly recognized. The identification of interactions between genetic factors has been progressively pursued via statistical or machine learning approaches. A large body of currently adopted methods, either parametrically or nonparametrically, predominantly focus on pairwise single marker interaction analysis. As genes are the functional units in living organisms, analysis by focusing on a gene as a system could potentially yield more biologically meaningful results. In this work, we conceptually propose a gene-centric framework for genome-wide gene-gene interaction detection. We treat each gene as a testing unit and derive a model-based kernel machine method for two-dimensional genome-wide scanning of gene-gene interactions. In addition to the biological advantage, our method is statistically appealing because it reduces the number of hypotheses tested in a genome-wide scan. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the method. The utility of the method is further demonstrated with applications to two real data sets.

In addition to the candidate gene approach, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely utilized to identify common variants that are associated with treatment response. In the wake of recent advances in scientific research, a paradigm shift from GWAS to wholegenome sequencing is expected, because of the reduced cost and the increased throughput of next-generation sequencing technologies. This review first outlines several promising methods for addressing gene-gene interactions in pharmacogenomics studies. We then summarize some candidate gene studies for various treatments with consideration of gene-gene interactions. Furthermore, we give a brief overview for the pharmacogenomics studies with the GWAS approach and describe the limitations of these GWAS in terms of gene-gene interactions. Future research in translational medicine promises to lead to mechanistic findings related to drug responsiveness in light of complex gene-gene interactions and will probably make major contributions to individualized medicine and therapeutic decision-making.

T-Gene: improved target gene prediction	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: Identifying the genes regulated by a given transcription factor (TF) (its 'target genes') is a key step in developing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Previously, we developed a method (CisMapper) for predicting the target genes of a TF based solely on the correlation between a histone modification at the TF's binding site and the expression of the gene across a set of tissues or cell lines. That approach is limited to organisms for which extensive histone and expression data are available, and does not explicitly incorporate the genomic distance between the TF and the gene. Results: We present the T-Gene algorithm, which overcomes these limitations. It can be used to predict which genes are most likely to be regulated by a TF, and which of the TF's binding sites are most likely involved in regulating particular genes. T-Gene calculates a novel score that combines distance and histone/expression correlation, and we show that this score accurately predicts when a regulatory element bound by a TF is in contact with a gene's promoter, achieving median precision above 60%. T-Gene is easy to use via its web server or as a command-line tool, and can also make accurate predictions (median precision above 40%) based on distance alone when extensive histone/expression data is not available for the organism. T-Gene provides an estimate of the statistical significance of each of its predictions.

In the "post-genomic" era, a need is emerging to elucidate the physiologic functions of myocardial genes, as well as potential adaptive and maladaptive modulations induced by environmental/epigenetic factors. Genome sequencing and analysis advances have become exponential lately, with escalation of our knowledge concerning sometimes controversial genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular diseases. Current technologies can identify candidate genes variously involved in diverse normal/abnormal morphomechanical phenotypes, and offer insights into multiple genetic factors implicated in complex cardiovascular syndromes. The expression profiles of thousands of genes are regularly ascertained under diverse conditions. Global analyses of gene expression levels are useful for cataloging genes and correlated phenotypes, and for elucidating the role of genes in maladies. Comparative expression of gene networks coupled to complex disorders can contribute insights as to how "modifier genes" influence the expressed phenotypes. Increasingly, a more comprehensive and detailed systematic understanding of genetic abnormalities underlying, for example, various genetic cardiomyopathies is emerging. Implementing genomic findings in cardiology practice may well lead directly to better diagnosing and therapeutics. There is currently evolving a strong appreciation for the value of studying gene anomalies, and doing so in a non-disjointed, cohesive manner. However, it is challenging for many-practitioners and investigators-to comprehend, interpret, and utilize the clinically increasingly accessible and affordable cardiovascular genomics studies. This survey addresses the need for fundamental understanding in this vital area.

However, relatively few findings of gene-gene or gene-environment interactions have been successfully reproduced. Besides the main issues associated with insufficient sample size in current studies, a complication is that interactions that rank high based on p-values often correspond to extreme forms of joint effects that are biologically less plausible. To reduce false positives and to increase power, we develop various gene-environment/gene-gene tests based on biologically more plausible constraints using bivariate isotonic regressions for case-control data. We extend our method to exploit gene-environment or gene-gene independence information, integrating the approach proposed by Chatterjee and Carroll. We propose appropriate nonparametric and parametric permutation procedures for evaluating the significance of the tests. Simulation's show that our method gains power over traditional unconstrained methods by reducing the sizes of alternative parameter spaces. We apply our method to several real-data examples, including an analysis of bladder cancer data to detect interactions between the NAT2 gene and smoking. We also show that the-proposed method is computationally feasible for large-scale problems by applying it to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) lung cancer GWAS data.

Gene-Gene Interaction Among WNT Genes for Oral Cleft in Trios	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						complex disease; family-based study; machine learning	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; STATISTICAL-METHODS; LIP; PALATE; MORPHOGENESIS; VARIANTS	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) have identified multiple genes as important in the etiology of this common birth defect. We performed a candidate gene/pathway analysis explicitly considering gene-gene (G x G) interaction to further explore the etiology of CL/P. Animal models have shown the WNT signaling pathway plays an important role in mid-facial development, and various genes in this pathway have been associated with nonsyndromic CL/P in previous studies. We propose a combined approach to search for possible G x G interactions using machine learning and regression-based methods to test for interactions between genes in the WNT family, and between these genes and other genes identified by GWAS in case-parent trios. Using this combined approach of regression-based and machine learning methods in CL/P case-parent trios, we found robust evidence of G x G interaction between markers in WNT5B and MAFB (empiric P-values = 0.0076 among Asian trios and P-values = 0.018 among European trios). Additional evidence for epistatic interaction between markers in WNT5A, IRF6, and C1orf107 was seen among Asian trios, and markers in the 8q24 region and WNT5B among European trios.

J	Al-Mubaid, H				Al-Mubaid, Hisham			Gene multifunctionality scoring using gene ontology	JOURNAL OF BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BICOB)	MAR, 2018	Las Vegas, NV			Multifunctional genes; functional genomics	MOONLIGHTING PROTEINS; PREDICTION; DATABASE	Multifunctional genes are important genes because of their essential roles in human cells. Studying and analyzing multifunctional genes can help understand disease mechanisms and drug discovery. We propose a computational method for scoring gene multifunctionality based on functional annotations of the target gene from the Gene Ontology. The method is based on identifying pairs of GO annotations that represent semantically different biological functions and any gene annotated with two annotations from one pair is considered multifunctional. The proposed method can be employed to identify multifunctional genes in the entire human genome using solely the GO annotations. We evaluated the proposed method in scoring multi functionality of all human genes using four criteria: gene-disease associations; protein protein interactions; gene studies with PubMed publications; and published known multifunctional gene sets. The evaluation results confirm the validity and reliability of the proposed method for identifying multifunctional human genes. The results across all four evaluation criteria were statistically significant in determining multifunctionality. For example, the method confirmed that multifunctional genes tend to be associated with diseases more than other genes, with significance p < 0.01. Moreover, consistent with all previous studies, proteins encoded by multifunctional genes, based on our method, are involved in protein protein interactions significantly more (p < 0.01) than other proteins.

These systems were originally invented as a delivery system for the transfection in vitro or in vivo. Several vectors are then developed for clinical use of gene medicines and currently some of them are approved as animal drugs. Conventional drug delivery system generally consists of approved (existing) materials to avoid additional pre-clinical or clinical studies. However, current vectors contain novel materials to improve an efficacy of gene medicines. Thus, these vectors have functions more than a mere delivery of active ingredients. For example some vectors have immunological functions such as adjuvants in vaccines. These new types of vectors are called 'intelligent' or 'innovative' vector system', since the concept or strategy for the development is completely different from conventional drug delivery systems. In this article, we described a current status of 'intelligent gene transfer vectors and discussed on the potentials of them.

However, the peculiarities of the mRNA structure, the versatility of the genetic code, and the dynamic nature of translation sometimes allow organisms to deviate from the standard rules of protein encoding. Bacteria can use several unorthodox modes of translation to express more than one protein from a single mRNA cistron. One such alternative path is the use of additional translation initiation sites within the gene. Proteins whose translation is initiated at different start sites within the same reading frame will differ in their N termini but will have identical C-terminal segments. On the other hand, alternative initiation of translation in a register different from the frame dictated by the primary start codon will yield a protein whose sequence is entirely different from the one encoded in the main frame. The use of internal mRNA codons as translation start sites is controlled by the nucleotide sequence and the mRNA folding. The proteins of the alternative proteome generated via the "genes-within-genes" strategy may carry important functions. In this review, we summarize the currently known examples of bacterial genes encoding more than one protein due to the utilization of additional translation start sites and discuss the known or proposed functions of the alternative polypeptides in relation to the main protein product of the gene. We also discuss recent proteome- and genome-wide approaches that will allow the discovery of novel translation initiation sites in a systematic fashion.

It is thought that gene-gene interactions play an important role in the etiology of cancer, cardiovascular, and immune-mediated disease. Interactions among genes are defined as phenotypic effects that differ from those observed for independent contributions of each gene, usually detected by univariate logistic regression methods. Using a multivariate extension of linkage disequilibrium (LD), we have developed a new method, based on distances between sample covariance matrices for groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to test for interaction effects of two groups of genes associated with a disease phenotype. Since a disease-associated interacting locus will often be in LD with more than one marker in the region, a method that examines a set of markers in a region collectively can offer greater power than traditional methods. Our method effectively identifies interaction effects in simulated data, as well as in data on the genetic contributions to the risk for graft-versus-host disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Our analysis focused primarily on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where haploinsufficient genes (HI; genes with dominant loss-of-function mutations) were found to be participating in gene expression processes, namely, the translation and regulation of gene transcription. Non-ribosomal HI genes (mainly regulators of gene transcription) were found to have more GIs and GCIs than haplosufficient (HS) genes. Several properties seem to lead to the enrichment of interactions, most notably, the following: importance, pleiotropy, gene expression level and gene expression variation. Importantly, after these properties were appropriately considered in the analysis, the correlation between dominance and GI/GCI degrees was still observed. Strikingly, for the GCIs of heterozygous strains, haploinsufficiency was the only property significantly correlated with the number of GCIs. We found ribosomal HI genes to be depleted in GIs/GCIs. This finding can be explained by their high variation in gene expression under different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. We observed the same distributions of GIs among non-ribosomal HI, ribosomal HI and HS genes in three other species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. One potentially interesting exception was the lack of significant differences in the degree of GIs between non-ribosomal HI and HS genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

The coordinated activation or repression of such genes occurs at specific stages of differentiation, or under the influence of external stimuli. As a rule, co-regulated genes are dispersed in the genome. However, there are also gene clusters, which contain paralogous genes that encode proteins with similar functions. In this aspect, they differ significantly from bacterial operons containing functionally linked genes that are not paralogs. In this review, we discuss the reasons for the existence of gene clusters in vertebrate cells and propose that clustering is necessary to ensure the possibility of selective activation of one of several similar genes.

An increasing number of studies indicate that, in most cases, the effect of a genetic locus on the phenotype is context-dependent, i.e. it is influenced by the genetic background and the environment in which the phenotype is measured. Still, the majority of the studies, in both model organisms and humans, that map the genetic regulation of phenotypic variation in complex traits primarily identify additive loci with independent effects. This does not reflect an absence of the contribution of genetic interactions to phenotypic variation, but instead is a consequence of the technical limitations in mapping gene-gene interactions (GGI) and gene-environment interactions (GEI). Yeast, with its detailed molecular understanding, diverse population genomics and ease of genetic manipulation, is a unique and powerful resource to study the contributions of GGI and GEI in the regulation of phenotypic variation. Here we review studies in yeast that have identified GGI and GEI that regulate phenotypic variation, and discuss the contribution of these findings in explaining missing heritability of complex traits, and how observations from these GGI and GEI studies enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying genetic robustness and adaptability that shape the architecture of the genotype-phenotype map.

Bayesian variable selection for hierarchical gene-environment and gene-gene interactions	HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							ASSOCIATION; RISK	We propose a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model framework that allows us to investigate the genetic and environmental effects, gene by gene interactions and gene by environment interactions in the same model. Our approach incorporates the natural hierarchical structure between the main effects and interaction effects into a mixture model, such that our methods tend to remove the irrelevant interaction effects more effectively, resulting in more robust and parsimonious models. We consider both strong and weak hierarchical models. For a strong hierarchical model, both the main effects between interacting factors must be present for the interactions to be considered in the model development, while for a weak hierarchical model, only one of the two main effects is required to be present for the interaction to be evaluated. Our simulation results show that the proposed strong and weak hierarchical mixture models work well in controlling false-positive rates and provide a powerful approach for identifying the predisposing effects and interactions in gene-environment interaction studies, in comparison with the naive model that does not impose this hierarchical constraint in most of the scenarios simulated. We illustrate our approach using data for lung cancer and cutaneous melanoma.

Molecular Basis of Gene-Gene Interaction: Cyclic Cross-Regulation of Gene Expression and Post-GWAS Gene-Gene Interaction Involved in Atrial Fibrillation	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; RISK-FACTORS; PITX2; VARIANTS; STROKE; ATBF1; SUSCEPTIBILITY; ASSOCIATION; PROTEIN; LOCUS	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia at the clinic. Recent GWAS identified several variants associated with AF, but they account for <10% of heritability. Gene-gene interaction is assumed to account for a significant portion of missing heritability. Among GWAS loci for AF, only three were replicated in the Chinese Han population, including SNP rs2106261 (G/A substitution) in ZFHX3, rs2200733 (C/T substitution) near PITX2c, and rs3807989 (A/G substitution) in CAV1. Thus, we analyzed the interaction among these three AF loci. We demonstrated significant interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 in three independent populations and combined population with 2,020 cases/5,315 controls. Compared to non-risk genotype GGCC, two-locus risk genotype AATT showed the highest odds ratio in three independent populations and the combined population (OR= 5.36 (95% CI 3.87-7.43), P= 8.00x10(-24)). The OR of 5.36 for AATT was significantly higher than the combined OR of 3.31 for both GGTT and AACC, suggesting a synergistic interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733. Relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) analysis also revealed significant interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 when exposed two copies of risk alleles (RERI=2.87, P<1.00x10(-4)) or exposed to one additional copy of risk allele (RERI=1.29, P<1.00x10(-4)). The INTERSNP program identified significant genotypic interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 under an additive by additive model (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97, P=0.02). Mechanistically, PITX2c negatively regulates expression of miR-1, which negatively regulates expression of ZFHX3, resulting in a positive regulation of ZFHX3 by PITX2c; ZFHX3 positively regulates expression of PITX2C, resulting in a cyclic loop of cross-regulation between ZFHX3 and PITX2c. Both ZFHX3 and PITX2c regulate expression of NPPA, TBX5 and NKX2.5. These results suggest that cyclic cross-regulation of gene expression is a molecular basis for gene-gene interactions involved in genetics of complex disease traits.

A body of evidence suggests VEGFs regulate critical processes during pregnancy and have been associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). However, little information is available regarding the interaction of these two major major angiogenesis-related systems in early human pregnancy. This study was conducted to investigate the association of gene polymorphisms and gene-gene interaction among genes in VEGFA and EG-VEGF systems and idiopathic RPL. A total of 98 women with history of idiopathic RPL and 142 controls were included, and 5 functional SNPs selected from VEGFA, KDR, EG-VEGF (PROK1), PROKR1 and PROKR2 were genotyped. We used multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis to choose a best model and evaluate gene-gene interactions. Ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA) was introduced to explore possible complex interactions. Two receptor gene polymorphisms [KDR (Q472H) and PROKR2 (V331M)] were significantly associated with idiopathic RPL (P < 0.01). The MDR test revealed that the KDR (Q472H) polymorphism was the best loci to be associated with RPL (P = 0.02). IPA revealed EG-VEGF and VEGFA systems shared several canonical signaling pathways that may contribute to gene-gene interactions, including the Akt, IL-8, EGFR, MAPK, SRC, VHL, HIF-1A and STAT3 signaling pathways. Two receptor gene polymorphisms [KDR (Q472H) and PROKR2 (V331M)] were significantly associated with idiopathic RPL. EG-VEGF and VEGFA systems shared several canonical signaling pathways that may contribute to gene-gene interactions, including the Akt, IL-8, EGFR, MAPK, SRC, VHL, HIF-1A and STAT3.

It has several applications in the field of bioinformatics like annotating/measuring gene-gene or protein-protein semantic similarity, identifying genes/proteins by their GO annotations for disease gene and target discovery, etc. To determine semantic similarity between genes, several semantic measures have been proposed in literature, which involve information content of GO-terms, GO tree structure, or the combination of both. But, most of the existing semantic similarity measures do not consider different topological and information theoretic aspects of GO-terms collectively. Inspired by this fact, in this article, we have first proposed three novel semantic similarity/distance measures for genes covering different aspects of GO-tree. These are further implanted in the frameworks of well-known multi-objective and single-objective based clustering algorithms to determine functionally similar genes. For comparative analysis, 10 popular existing GO based semantic similarity/distance measures and tools are also considered. Experimental results on Mouse genome, Yeast, and Human genome datasets evidently demonstrate the supremacy of multi-objective clustering algorithms in association with proposed multi-factored similarity/distance measures. Clustering outcomes are further validated by conducting some biological/statistical significance tests. Supplementary information is available at https://www.iitp.ac.in/sriparna/journals.html.

Understanding how these networks rewire between two different disease states is an important task in genomic research. Although many computational methods have been proposed to undertake this task via differential network analysis, most of them are designed fora predefined data type. With the development of the high throughput technologies, gene activity measurements can be collected from different aspects (e.g., mRNA expression and DNA mutation). These different data types might share some common characteristics and include certain unique properties of data type. New methods are needed to explore the similarity and difference between differential networks estimated from different data types. In this study, we develop a new differential network inference model which identifies gene network rewiring by combining gene expression and gene mutation data. Similarities and differences between different data types are learned via a group bridge penalty function. Simulation studies have demonstrated that our method consistently outperforms the competing methods. We also apply our method to identify gene network rewiring associated with ovarian cancer platinum resistance from The Cancer Genome Atlas data. There are certain differential edges common to both data types and some differential edges unique to individual data types. Hub genes in the differential networks inferred by our method play important roles in ovarian cancer drug resistance.

We examined the role of the gene-gene interactions of clock genes in mood disorder. Methods: We included 413 patients with mood disorder and 1294 controls. The clock genes investigated were BHLHB2, CLOCK, CSNK1E, NR1D1, PER2, PER3, and TIMELESS. Allele, genotype, and haplotype associations were tested. Gene--gene interactions were analyzed using the non-parametric model-free multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Results: TIMELESS rs4630333 and CSNKIE rs135745 were significantly associated with both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The CLOCK haplotype was also strongly associated. The genetic roles of these SNPs were consistent from the allele and genotypic associations to the MDR interaction results. In MDR analysis, the combination of TIMELESS rs4630333 and CSNKIE rs135745 exhibited the most significant association with mood disorders in the two-locus model. BHLHB2 rs2137947 for major depressive disorder and CLOCK rs12649507 for bipolar disorder were the most significant third loci in the three-locus combination model. The four-locus SNP combination model showed the best balanced accuracy (BA), but its cross-validation consistency (CVC) was unsatisfactory. Limitations: We included only 17 SNPs for seven circadian genes due to our limited resources; all subjects were ethnically Korean. Conclusions: Our results suggest significant single-gene associations and gene-gene interactions of circadian genes with mood disorder. Gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in mood disorder, even when individual clock genes do not have significant roles.

In this study, we adopt the statistical modeling approach, where interactions are represented by product terms in regression models. For the identification of important interactions, we adopt penalization, which has been used in many genomic studies. Straightforward application of penalization does not respect the "main effect, interaction" hierarchical structure. A few recently proposed methods respect this structure by applying constrained penalization. However, they demand very complicated computational algorithms and can only accommodate a small number of genomic measurements. We propose a computationally fast penalization method that can identify important gene-environment and gene-gene interactions and respect a strong hierarchical structure. The method takes a stagewise approach and progressively expands its optimization domain to account for possible hierarchical interactions. It is applicable to multiple data types and models. A coordinate descent method is utilized to produce the entire regularized solution path. Simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed method. We analyze a lung cancer prognosis study with gene expression measurements and identify important gene-environment interactions.

This study was to detect 12 BCL3-PVRL2-TOMM40 SNPs, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on dyslipidemia in the Chinese Maonan population. Genotyping was performed in 1130 normal and 832 dyslipidemia participants. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction was used to screen the best interaction combination among SNPs and environmental exposures. Allele and genotype frequencies of the detected SNPs were different between the two groups (P < 0.05-0.001). Association of the 12 SNPs and serum lipid levels was observed (P < 0.004-0.001). Multiple-locus linkage disequilibrium was not statistically independent in the population (D' = 0.01-0.98). The dominant model of rs8100239 and rs157580 SNPs, several haplotypes and G x G interaction haplotypes contributed to a protection, whereas the dominant model of rs10402271, rs3810143, rs519113, rs6859 SNPs, another haplotypes and G x G interaction haplotypes revealed an increased morbidity function (P < 0.05-0.001). There were significant three-locus model involving SNP-SNP, SNP-environment, haplotype-haplotype interactions (P < 0.05-0.001).

Although a number of computational approaches have been developed to infer differential networks from high-throughput data, most of them only focus on gene expression data. The valuable static gene regulatory network data accumulated in recent biomedical researches are neglected. In this study, we propose a new Gaussian graphical model-based method to infer differential networks by integrating gene expression and static gene regulatory network data. We first evaluate the empirical performance of our method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods using simulation data. We also apply our method to The Cancer Genome Atlas data to identify gene network rewiring between ovarian cancers with different platinum responses, and rewiring between breast cancers of luminal A subtype and basal-like subtype. Hub genes in the estimated differential networks rediscover known genes associated with platinum resistance in ovarian cancer and signatures of the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes.

Gene-gene interaction between tuberculosis candidate genes in a South African population	MAMMALIAN GENOME			English	Article							MANNOSE-BINDING LECTIN; INTERFERON-GAMMA GENE; HONG-KONG CHINESE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; NRAMP1 GENE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; KOREAN CHILDREN; MARKER ALLELES; HUMAN-DISEASES; DC-SIGN	In a complex disease such as tuberculosis (TB) it is increasingly evident that gene-gene interactions play a far more important role in an individual's susceptibility to develop the disease than single polymorphisms on their own, as one gene can enhance or hinder the expression of another gene. Gene-gene interaction analysis is a new approach to elucidate susceptibility to TB. The possibility of gene-gene interactions was assessed, focusing on 11 polymorphisms in nine genes (DC-SIGN, IFN-gamma, IFNGR1, IL-8, IL-1Ra, MBL, NRAMP1, RANTES, and SP-D) that have been associated with TB, some repeatedly. An optimal model, which best describes and predicts TB case-control status, was constructed. Significant interactions were detected between eight pairs of variants. The models fitted the observed data extremely well, with p < 0.0001 for all eight models. A highly significant interaction was detected between INFGR1 and NRAMP1, which is not surprising because macrophage activation is greatly enhanced by IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma response elements that are present in the human NRAMP1 promoter region, providing further evidence for their interaction. This study enabled us to test the theory that disease outcome may be due to interaction of several gene effects. With eight instances of statistically significant gene-gene interactions, the importance of epistasis is clearly identifiable in this study. Methods for studying gene-gene interactions are based on a multilocus and multigene approach, consistent with the nature of complex-trait diseases, and may provide the paradigm for future genetic studies of TB.

However, in this paper we show that in genetic association studies it is not typically possible to construct exact permutation tests of gene-gene or gene-environment interaction hypotheses. We describe an alternative to the permutation approach in testing for interaction, a parametric bootstrap approach. Using simulations, we compare the finite-sample properties of a few often-used permutation tests and the parametric bootstrap. We consider interactions of an exposure with single and multiple polymorphisms. Finally, we address when permutation tests of interaction will be approximately valid in large samples for specific test statistics.

Genetic studies have identified multiple loci associated with tumor susceptibility. However, little is known about how germline polymorphisms interact with one another and with somatic mutations within a tumor to mediate acquisition of cancer traits. Here, we survey recent studies showing gene-gene interactions, also known as epistases, affecting genetic susceptibility in colorectal, gastric and esophageal cancers. We also catalog epistasis types and cancer hallmarks with respect to the interacting genes. A total of 22 gene variation pairs displayed all levels of statistical epistasis, including synergistic, redundant, suppressive and co-suppressive interactions. Five genes primarily involved in base excision repair formed a linear topology in the interaction network, MUTYH-OGG1-XRCC1-PARP1-MMP2, and three genes in mTOR cell-proliferation pathway formed another linear network, PRKAG2-RPS6KB1-PIK3CA. Discrete pairwise epistasis was also found in nucleotide excision repair, detoxification, proliferation, TP53, TGF-beta and other pathways. We propose that three modes of biological interaction underlie the molecular mechanisms for statistical epistasis. The direct binding, linear pathway and convergence modes can exhibit any level of statistical epistasis in susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancers, and this is likely true for other complex diseases as well. This review highlights the link between cancer hallmarks and susceptibility genes.

Gene-gene interactions in APOL1-associated nephropathy	NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						African American; APOL1; bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4); kidney disease; podocin (NPHS2); serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8 (SDCCAG8)	RESISTANT NEPHROTIC SYNDROME; FOCAL-SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; NONDIABETIC NEPHROPATHY; APOL1 VARIANTS; DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY; SLIT DIAPHRAGM; PODOCIN	Background. Two APOL1 nephropathy variants confer substantial risk for non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in African Americans (AAs). Since not all genetically high-risk individuals develop ESKD, modifying factors likely contribute. Forty-two potentially interactive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a genome-wide association study in non-diabetic ESKD were tested for interaction with APOL1 to identify genes modifying risk for non-diabetic nephropathy. Methods. SNPs were examined in an expanded sample of 1367 AA non-diabetic ESKD cases and 1504 AA non-nephropathy controls, with validation in an independent family-based cohort containing 608 first-degree relatives of index cases with non-diabetic ESKD. Logistic regression and mixed models were fitted to test for interaction effects with APOL1 on ESKD, estimated kidney function and albuminuria. Results. Among ESKD samples, 14 of 42 SNPs demonstrated suggestive APOL1 interaction with P-values <0.05. After Bonferroni correction, significant interactions with APOL1 were seen with SNPs in podocin (rs16854341; NPHS2, P = 8.0 x 10(-4)), in SDCCAG8 (rs2802723; P = 5.0 x 10(-4)) and near BMP4 (rs8014363; P = 1.0 x 10(-3)); with trends for ENOX1 (rs9533534; P = 2.2 x 10(-3)) and near TRIB1 (rs4457349; P = 5.7 x 10(-3)). The minor allele in NPHS2 markedly changed the APOL1-ESKD association odds ratio (OR) from 7.03 to 1.76 (similar to 50% reduction in effect per copy of the minor allele), rs2802723 changed the OR from 5.1 to 10.5, and rs8014363 increased the OR from 4.8 to 9.5. NPHS2 (P = 0.05) and SDCCAG8 (P = 0.03) SNPs demonstrated APOL1 interaction with albuminuria in independent family-based samples. Conclusions. Variants in NPHS2, SDCCAG8 and near BMP4 appear to interact with APOL1 to modulate the risk for nondiabetic ESKD in AAs.

Most of the literature focuses on low-order interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant main effects. Results: In this paper we propose an original approach for detecting epistasis at the gene level, without systematically filtering on significant genes. We first compute interaction variables for each gene pair by finding its Eigen-Epistasis component, defined as the linear combination of Gene SNPs having the highest correlation with the phenotype. The selection of significant effects is done using a penalized regression method based on Group Lasso controlling the False Discovery Rate. Conclusion: The method is tested against two recent alternative proposals from the literature using synthetic data, and shows good performances in different settings. We demonstrate the power of our approach by detecting new gene-gene interactions on three genome-wide association studies.

Although these discoveries offer significant progress, selecting optimal methods for the vector delivery remains a key component for efficient cardiac gene therapy to validate the targets in rodent models and to test clinically relevant ones in pre-clinical models. Although the goals of higher transduction efficiency and cardiac specificity can be achieved with several delivery methods, the invasiveness and patient safety remain unclear for clinical application. In this review, we discuss various features of the currently available vector delivery methods for cardiac gene therapy. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In addition, we examined the interactions between demographic and lifestyle risk factors (environmental factors including age, sex, smoking status, alcohol intake) and RAAS polymorphisms on disease risk. Methods: A total of 1089 subjects who underwent coronary angiography were enrolled in this study. Eight RAAS polymorphisms were genotyped in this population: the G2350A (rs4343) polymorphism in exon 17 of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, 1166A -> C (rs5186) and 573C/T (rs5182) in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) gene, the -344C -> T transversion (rs1799998) in the aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene, and the G-217A (rs5049), G-6A (rs5051), M235T (rs699; T4072C), and T174M (rs4762; C3889T) polymorphisms in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene. Subjects with coronary heart disease were defined as those with at least 50% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery, and, the severity of coronary atherosclerosis was defined by the Gensini scoring system. Results: Compared to the subjects with AA genotype, the subjects with AG + GG genotype of rs1799998 had significant lower gensini score (p=0.029). After adjusting for age, gender, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake status, the AG genotype (OR 0.717 95% CI 0.541-0.950, p=0.021) and the AG + GG genotype (OR 0.730 95% CI 0.559-0.954, p=0.021) distributions of rs1799998 were significantly different between the cases and controls compare to the AA genotype. Subjects with three at-risk loci had increased risk of coronary artery disease compared to subjects carrying 0 or 1 risk-associated polymorphism (OR [95% CI]: 1.579 [1.077-2.316], p=0.019), and the significance of the association was not reduced after adjusting for age, sex, cigarette smoking, or alcohol intake (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 1.673 [1.116-2.507], p=0.013). The results of multifactor-dimensionality reduction analysis revealed an interaction effect of CYP11B2 -344C -> T, age, and smoking status on the risk of coronary heart disease (training OR [95% CI]: 3.7685 [2.8463-4.9895], p<0.0001; testing OR [95% CI]: 2.7583 [1.2038-6.3203], p=0.015). Conclusions: Subjects who carried the G allele of the rs1799998 polymorphism significantly associated with coronary heart disease and severity of coronary atherosclerosis estimated by the Gensini score in the whole population of the study. And, multiple RAAS gene polymorphisms are associated with coronary artery disease. The interaction of the CYP11B2 -344C -> T polymorphism (rs1799998), age, and smoking status is also associated with enhanced risk of coronary artery disease. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

Processes involving re-organization of pre-existing genes, notably after gene duplication, have been extensively described(1,2). In contrast, de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences devoid of genes, or 'non-genic' sequences, is expected to produce insignificant polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions(1,3-6). Here we formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de novo through transitory proto-genes(4) generated by widespread translational activity in non-genic sequences. Testing this model at the genome scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences. These translation events seem to provide adaptive potential(7), as suggested by their differential regulation upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection. In line with our model, we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can be placed within an evolutionary continuum ranging from non-genic sequences to genes. We identify similar to 1,900 candidate proto-genes among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication. Our work illustrates that evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences to generate adaptive functional innovation.

This study addresses the relationship between proteome innovation by horizontal gene transfer and genome content in Proteobacteria. We characterize the transferred genes, focusing on the protein domain compositions and their relationships with the existing protein domain superfamilies in the genome. In agreement with previous observations, we find that the protein domain architectures of horizontally transferred genes are significantly shorter than the genomic average. Furthermore, protein domains that are more common in the total pool of genomes appear to have a proportionally higher chance to be transferred. This suggests that transfer events behave as if they were drawn randomly from a cross-genomic community gene pool, much like gene duplicates are drawn from a genomic gene pool. Finally, horizontally transferred genes carry domains of exogenous families less frequently for larger genomes, although they might do it more than expected by chance.

J	Greenspan, NS				Greenspan, Neil S.			Attributing functions to genes and gene products	TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Review							IFN-GAMMA; INDUCTION; MICE	A major focus of modern biochemical, biophysical and cell biological research is the attribution of function to elements of structure: gene products, genes and higher-order cellular structures. Misunderstandings and controversies can arise in connection with such assignments, in part because of the logical complexity inherent in the relating of structure to function and the failure to distinguish clearly among the different senses in which function can be imputed to elements of structure. I explore distinct ways in which functions are connected to structures and factors that contribute to the context-dependence of such associations so that the multiple senses of function can be made explicit.

J	Chattopadhyay, A; Lu, TP				Chattopadhyay, Amrita; Lu, Tzu-Pin			Gene-gene interaction: the curse of dimensionality	ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Review						Gene-gene interaction; parallel computing; PySpark; deep-learning (DL); machine-learning (ML); multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR)	MISSING HERITABILITY; REDUCTION METHOD; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EPISTASIS; MAP	Identified genetic variants from genome wide association studies frequently show only modest effects on the disease risk, leading to the "missing heritability" problem. An avenue, to account for a part of this "missingness" is to evaluate gene-gene interactions (epistasis) thereby elucidating their effect on complex diseases. This can potentially help with identifying gene functions, pathways, and drug targets. However, the exhaustive evaluation of all possible genetic interactions among millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) raises several issues, otherwise known as the "curse of dimensionality". The dimensionality involved in the epistatic analysis of such exponentially growing SNPs diminishes the usefulness of traditional, parametric statistical methods. With the immense popularity of multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), a non-parametric method, proposed in 2001, that classifies multi-dimensional genotypes into one-dimensional binary approaches, led to the emergence of a fast-growing collection of methods that were based on the MDR approach. Moreover, machine-learning (ML) methods such as random forests and neural networks (NNs), deep-learning (DL) approaches, and hybrid approaches have also been applied profusely, in the recent years, to tackle this dimensionality issue associated with whole genome gene-gene interaction studies. However, exhaustive searching in MDR based approaches or variable selection in ML methods, still pose the risk of missing out on relevant SNPs. Furthermore, interpretability issues are a major hindrance for DL methods. To minimize this loss of information, Python based tools such as PySpark can potentially take advantage of distributed computing resources in the cloud, to bring back smaller subsets of data for further local analysis. Parallel computing can be a powerful resource that stands to fight this "curse". PySpark supports all standard Python libraries and C extensions thus making it convenient to write codes to deliver dramatic improvements in processing speed for extraordinarily large sets of data.

While current gene-based GxG methods tend to be designed for two or a few genes, for complex traits, it is often common to have a list of many candidate genes to explore GxG. We propose a regression model with pathway-guided regularization for detecting interactions among genes. Specifically, we use the principal components to summarize the SNP-SNP interactions between a gene pair, and use an L1 penalty that incorporates adaptive weights based on biological guidance and trait supervision to identify important main and interaction effects. Our approach aims to combine biological guidance and data adaptiveness, and yields credible findings that may be likely to shed insights in order to formulate biological hypotheses for further molecular studies. The proposed approach can be used to explore the GxG with a list of many candidate genes and is applicable even when sample size is smaller than the number of predictors studied. We evaluate the utility of the proposed method using simulation and real data analysis. The results suggest improved performance over methods not utilizing pathway and trait guidance.

Through mutational analyses in 7325 individuals, we report four interactions (defined as departures from a multiplicative model) between mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes ATM and CHEK2 with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (case-only interaction between ATM and BRCA1/BRCA2 combined, P = 5.9 x 10(-4); ATM and BRCA1, P = 0.01; ATM and BRCA2, P = 0.02; CHEK2 and BRCA1/BRCA2 combined, P = 2.1 x 10(-4); CHEK2 and BRCA1, P = 0.01; CHEK2 and BRCA2, P = 0.01). The interactions are such that the resultant risk of breast cancer is lower than the multiplicative product of the constituent risks, and plausibly reflect the functional relationships of the encoded proteins in DNA repair. These findings have important implications for models of disease predisposition and clinical translation.

Quantitative set analysis for gene expression: a method to quantify gene set differential expression including gene-gene correlations	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; HEPATITIS-C VIRUS; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS; BRIEF BOUT; INTERFERON; PATHWAY	Enrichment analysis of gene sets is a popular approach that provides a functional interpretation of genome-wide expression data. Existing tests are affected by inter-gene correlations, resulting in a high Type I error. The most widely used test, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, relies on computationally intensive permutations of sample labels to generate a null distribution that preserves gene-gene correlations. A more recent approach, CAMERA, attempts to correct for these correlations by estimating a variance inflation factor directly from the data. Although these methods generate P-values for detecting gene set activity, they are unable to produce confidence intervals or allow for post hoc comparisons. We have developed a new computational framework for Quantitative Set Analysis of Gene Expression (QuSAGE). QuSAGE accounts for inter-gene correlations, improves the estimation of the variance inflation factor and, rather than evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a P-value, it quantifies gene-set activity with a complete probability density function. From this probability density function, P-values and confidence intervals can be extracted and post hoc analysis can be carried out while maintaining statistical traceability. Compared with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and CAMERA, QuSAGE exhibits better sensitivity and specificity on real data profiling the response to interferon therapy (in chronic Hepatitis C virus patients) and Influenza A virus infection. QuSAGE is available as an R package, which includes the core functions for the method as well as functions to plot and visualize the results.

This review attempts to survey the potential to use traditional pharmaceuticals as opposed to biopharmaceuticals to treat single-gene disorders. The available strategies include the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to alter splicing or knock-down expression of a transcript, siRNAs to knock-down gene expression and drugs for nonsense mutation read-through. There is an approved drug for biallelic knock-down of the APOB gene as treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia. Both ASOs and siRNAs are being explored to knock-down the transthyretin gene to prevent the related form of amyloidosis. The use of ASOs to alter gene-splicing to treat spinal muscular atrophy is in phase 3 clinical trials. Work is progressing on the use of ASOs to activate the normally silent paternal copy of the imprinted UBE3A gene in neurons as a treatment for Angelman syndrome. A gene-activation or genespecific ramp-up strategy would be generally helpful if such could be developed. There is exciting theoretical potential for converting biopharmaceutical strategies such gene correction and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to a synthetic pharmaceutical approach.

J	Barkats, M				Barkats, Martine			SMA: from gene discovery to gene therapy	M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES			French	Review							SPINAL MUSCULAR-ATROPHY; DELIVERY; PHENOTYPE; NEURONS; MICE	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic disease leading to infant mortality. This neuro-muscular disorder is caused by the loss or mutation of the telomeric copy of the 'survival of motor neuron' (Smn) gene, termed SMN1. Loss of SMN1 leads to reduced SMN protein levels, inducing degeneration of motor neurons (MN) and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Gene therapy, consisting of reintroducing SMN1 in the MNs, is an attractive approach for SMA. We showed the most efficient rescue of SMA mice to date after a single intravenous injection of an AAV9 expressing SMN1, highlighting the considerable potential of this method for the treatment of human SMA. Recently, a startup led by the Dr Kaspar decided to test this experimental approach in children with SMA type 1. Dr Mendell, in charge of this clinical project, showed a very significant increase of the lifespan and motor function of the patients (until 4 years) after a single injection of AAV9-SMN1 (named ZolgenSMA (R)) into an arm or leg vein. This gene therapy treatment obtained a marketing authorization by the FDA in May 24 and is now the first efficient therapy for neuromuscular disease.

In the quest for disease susceptibility factors and the search for the 'missing heritability', supplementary and complementary efforts have been undertaken. These include the inclusion of several genetic inheritance assumptions in model development, the consideration of different sources of information, and the acknowledgement of disease underlying pathways of networks. The search for epistasis or gene-gene interaction effects on traits of interest is marked by an exponential growth, not only in terms of methodological development, but also in terms of practical applications, translation of statistical epistasis to biological epistasis and integration of omics information sources. The current popularity of the field, as well as its attraction to interdisciplinary teams, each making valuable contributions with sometimes rather unique viewpoints, renders it impossible to give an exhaustive review of to-date available approaches for epistasis screening. The purpose of this work is to give a perspective view on a selection of currently active analysis strategies and concerns in the context of epistasis detection, and to provide an eye to the future of gene-gene interaction analysis.

Gene-gene Interaction Analyses for Atrial Fibrillation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN-INTERACTION MAPS; FAMILIAL AGGREGATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; BREAST-CANCER; ASSOCIATION; RISK; VARIANTS; DISEASE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; METAANALYSIS	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heritable disease that affects more than thirty million individuals worldwide. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the study of genetic determinants of AF. The objective of our study is to examine the effect of gene-gene interaction on AF susceptibility. We performed a large-scale association analysis of gene-gene interactions with AF in 8,173 AF cases, and 65,237 AF-free referents collected from 15 studies for discovery. We examined putative interactions between genome-wide SNPs and 17 known AF-related SNPs. The top interactions were then tested for association in an independent cohort for replication, which included more than 2,363 AF cases and 114,746 AF-free referents. One interaction, between rs7164883 at the HCN4 locus and rs4980345 at the SLC28A1 locus, was found to be significantly associated with AF in the discovery cohorts (interaction OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27-1.65, P = 4.3 x 10(-8)). Eight additional gene-gene interactions were also marginally significant (P < 5 x 10(-7)). However, none of the top interactions were replicated. In summary, we did not find significant interactions that were associated with AF susceptibility. Future increases in sample size and denser genotyping might facilitate the identification of gene-gene interactions associated with AF.

Extracting Gene-Gene Interactions Through Curve Fitting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Gene expressions; gene interaction network; least-squares fitting; microarray data; transcriptional regulation	TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; REGULATORY NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; MODULES	This paper presents a simple and novel curve fitting approach for generating simple gene regulatory subnetworks from time series gene expression data. Microarray experiments simultaneously generate massive data sets and help immensely in the large-scale study of gene expression patterns. Initial biclustering reduces the search space in the high-dimensional microarray data. The least-squares error between fitting of gene pairs is minimized to extract a set of gene-gene interactions, involving transcriptional regulation of genes. The higher error values are eliminated to retain only the strong interacting gene pairs in the resultant gene regulatory subnetwork. Next the algorithm is extended to a generalized framework to enhance its capability. The methodology takes care of the higher-order dependencies involving multiple genes co-regulating a single gene, while eliminating the need for user-defined parameters. It has been applied to the time-series Yeast data, and the experimental results biologically validated using standard databases and literature.	[Das, Ranajit; Mitra, Sushmita; Murthy, C.

Genome-wide H3 mapping showed that Spt6 preferentially maintains nucleosomes within the first 500 bases of genes and helps define nucleosome-depleted regions in 5' and 3' flanking sequences. In Spt6-depleted cells, H3 loss at 5' ends correlates with reduced pol II density suggesting enhanced transcription elongation. Consistent with its 'Suppressor of Ty' (Spt) phenotype, Spt6 inactivation caused localized H3 eviction over 1-2 nucleosomes at 5' ends of Ty elements. H3 displacement differed between genes driven by promoters with 'open'/DPN and 'closed'/OPN chromatin conformations with similar pol II densities. More eviction occurred on genes with 'closed' promoters, associated with 'noisy' transcription. Moreover, swapping of 'open' and 'closed' promoters showed that they can specify distinct downstream patterns of histone eviction/deposition. These observations suggest a novel function for promoters in dictating histone dynamics within genes possibly through effects on transcriptional bursting or elongation rate.

In this article an overview of the successful gene therapy clinical trials is provided and the potential targets for gene doping are highlighted. Depending on whether a doping gene product is secreted from the engineered cells or is retained locally to, or inside engineered cells will, to some extent, determine the likelihood of detection. It is clear that effective gene delivery technologies now exist and it is important that detection and prevention plans are in place.

Overlapping genes: a window on gene evolvability	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Overlapping genes; Evolution; Expression regulation; Operon	TRANSCRIPTION TERMINATION; PROKARYOTIC GENES; GENOMES; EVOLUTION; BACTERIA; INITIATION; SEQUENCE	Background: The forces underlying genome architecture and organization are still only poorly understood in detail. Overlapping genes (genes partially or entirely overlapping) represent a genomic feature that is shared widely across biological organisms ranging from viruses to multi-cellular organisms. In bacteria, a third of the annotated genes are involved in an overlap. Despite the widespread nature of this arrangement, its evolutionary origins and biological ramifications have so far eluded explanation. Results: Here we present a comparative approach using information from 699 bacterial genomes that sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of overlapping genes. We show that these structures exhibit high levels of plasticity. Conclusions: We propose a simple model allowing us to explain the observed properties of overlapping genes based on the importance of initiation and termination of transcriptional and translational processes. We believe that taking into account the processes leading to the expression of protein-coding genes hold the key to the understanding of overlapping genes structures.

We took advantage of oat plants carrying single maize chromosomes in different cultivars, called oat-maize addition (OMA) lines, which permitted us to determine whether regulation of gene expression was conserved between the two species. We found that gamma-zeins are expressed in OMA7.06, which carries maize chromosome 7 even in the absence of the trans-acting maize prolamin-box-binding factor (PBF), which regulates their expression. This is likely because oat PBF can substitute for the function of maize PBF as shown in our transient expression data, using a gamma-zein promoter fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite this conservation, the younger, recently amplified prolamin genes in maize, absent in oat, are not expressed in the corresponding OMAs. However, maize can express the oldest prolamin gene, the wheat high-molecular weight glutenin Dx5 gene, even when maize Pbf is knocked down (through PbfRNAi), and/or another maize transcription factor, Opaque-2 (O2) is knocked out (in maize o2 mutant). Therefore, older genes are conserved in their regulation, whereas younger ones diverged during evolution and eventually acquired a new repertoire of suitable transcriptional activators.

However, automatic GO maintenance remains to be difficult because of the complex logical reasoning and the need of biological knowledge that are not explicitly represented in the GO. The existing studies either construct whole GO based on network data or only infer the relations between existing GO terms. None is purposed to add new terms automatically to the existing GO. Results: We proposed a new algorithm 'GOExtender' to efficiently identify all the connected gene pairs labeled by the same parent GO terms. GOExtender is used to predict new GO terms with biological network data, and connect them to the existing GO. Evaluation tests on biological process and cellular component categories of different GO releases showed that GOExtender can extend new GO terms automatically based on the biological network. Furthermore, we applied GOExtender to the recent release of GO and discovered new GO terms with strong support from literature.

Genes and gene models, an important distinction	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Review						comparative genomics; functional genomics; gene prediction; genomics; maize; phenotype	GENOME; MAIZE; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; ARABIDOPSIS; CONSISTENT; SUBGENOMES	Genome sequencing has fundamentally changed how plant biologists think about genes. All or nearly all genes can ultimately be associated with a gene model. However, many gene models appear to play little or no role in the traits of an organism. A range of structural, molecular, population and evolutionary features all show a separation between genes with known phenotypes and the overall set of annotated gene models. These different features could be combined to develop models to distinguish the genes that determine the traits of plants from the subset gene other annotated gene models which are unlikely to play a role in doing so. Efforts to identify the subset of annotated gene models likely involved in specifying the characteristics of plants would help aid a wide range of researchers.

Gene therapy vectors use a specific therapeutic transgene that causes death in cancer cells. In early attempts at gene therapy, therapeutic transgenes were driven by non-specific vectors which induced toxicity to normal cells in addition to the cancer cells. Recently, novel cancer specific viral vectors have been developed that target cancer cells leaving normal cells unharmed. Here we review such cancer specific gene therapy systems currently used in the treatment of cancer and discuss the major challenges and future directions in this field.

Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions detected by transcriptome sequence analysis in twins	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							WIDE ASSOCIATION; FATTY-ACIDS; POLYMORPHISMS; NUCLEOTIDE; DISCORDANT; HUMANS; ADIPOQ; RNA	Understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression is an intermediate step in understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. RNA sequencing technologies have improved the quantification of gene expression and allow measurement of allele-specific expression (ASE). ASE is hypothesized to result from the direct effect of cis regulatory variants, but a proper estimation of the causes of ASE has not been performed thus far. In this study, we take advantage of a sample of twins to measure the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects to ASE, and we find substantial effects from gene x gene (GxG) and gene x environment (GxE) interactions. We propose a model where ASE requires genetic variability in cis, a difference in the sequence of both alleles, but where the magnitude of the ASE effect depends on trans genetic and environmental factors that interact with the cis genetic variants.

In addition to the heterogeneity of hypertension resulting in inconsistent results, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may play a major role in the pathogenesis of hypertension rather than a single gene or environmental factor. Methods: A case-control study consisting of 1,652 individuals (hypertension, 816; control, 836) was conducted in Maonan ethnic minority of China. Genotyping of the four SNPs was performed by the next-generation sequencing technology. Results: The frequencies of minor alleles and genotypes of four SNPs were different between the two groups (p < 0.001). According to genetic dominance model analysis, three (rs1004467, rs11191548, and rs17249754) SNPs and two haplotypes (CYP17A1 rs1004467G-rs11191548C and ATP2B1 rs1401982G-rs17249754A) were negatively correlated, whereas rs1401982 SNP and the other two haplotypes (CYP17A1 rs1004467A-rs11191548T and ATP2B1 rs1401982A-rs17249754G) were positively associated with hypertension risk (p <= 0.002 for all). Two best significant two-locus models were screened out by GMDR software involving SNP-environment (rs11191548 and BMI >= 24 kg/m(2)) and haplotype-environment (CYP17A1 rs1004467G-rs11191548C and BMI >= 24 kg/m(2)) interactions (p <= 0.01). The subjects carrying some genotypes increased the hypertension risk. Conclusions: Our outcomes implied that the rs1004467, rs11191548, and rs17249754 SNPs and CYP17A1 rs1004467G-rs11191548C and ATP2B1 rs1401982G-rs17249754A haplotypes have protective effects, whereas the rs1401982 SNP and CYP17A1 rs1004467A-rs11191548T and ATP2B1 rs1401982A-rs17249754G haplotypes showed adverse effect on the prevalence of hypertension. Several SNP-environment interactions were also detected.

Numerous genome-wide studies identified more than 100 genes in 22 chromosomes associated with atopic asthma, and different genetic backgrounds in different environments could modulate susceptibility to atopic asthma. Current knowledge emphasizes the effect of tobacco smoke on the development of childhood asthma. This suggests that asthma, although heritable, is significantly affected by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Evidence has recently shown that molecular mechanism of a complex disease may be limited to not only DNA sequence differences, but also gene-environmental interactions for epigenetic difference. This paper reviews and summarizes how gene-gene and gene-environment interactions affect IgE production and the development of atopic asthma in prenatal and childhood stages. Based on the mechanisms responsible for perinatal gene-environment interactions on IgE production and development of asthma, we formulate several potential strategies to prevent the development of asthma in the perinatal stage.

The development of statistical procedures for searching gene-gene interaction at the SNP-set level has indeed recently grown in popularity as these methods confer advantage in both statistical power and biological interpretation. However, all these methods have been implemented in home made softwares that are for most of them available only on request to the authors and at best have a web interface. Since the implementation of these methods is not straightforward, there is a need for a user-friendly tool to perform gene-based genegene interaction. The purpose of GeneGeneInteR is to propose a collection of tools for all the steps involved in gene-based gene-gene interaction testing in case-control association studies. Illustrated by an example of a dataset related to rheumatoid arthritis, this paper details the implementation of the functions available in GeneGeneInteR to perform an analysis of a collection of SNP sets. Such an analysis aims at addressing the complete statistical pipeline going from data importation to the visualization of the results through data manipulation and statistical analysis.

A total of 1193 patients (579 men, 614 women) with type 2 diabetes mellitus were selected, including 397 diabetic retinopathy patients and 796 controls (type 2 diabetes mellitus patients without diabetic retinopathy); the mean age of all participants was 56.7 +/- 13.9 years. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected: rs507392, rs1617640, and rs551238. The t-test was used for comparison of erythropoietin protein level erythropoietin levels in patients having different erythropoietin genotypes. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between three single nucleotide polymorphisms and diabetic retinopathy. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confident interval (95% CI) were calculated. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction was employed to analyze the impact of interaction among three single nucleotide polymorphisms on CVD risk. After covariates adjustment, the carriers of homozygous mutant of three single nucleotide polymorphisms have higher diabetic retinopathy risk than those with wild-type homozygotes, OR (95% CI) were 2.04 (1.12-2.35), 1.87 (1.10-2.41) and 1.15 (1.06-1.76), respectively. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction model indicated a significant three-locus model (p = 0.0010) involving rs507392, rs1617640, and rs551238. Overall, the three-locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 10 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of 60.72%. Subjects with TC or CC-TG or GG-AC or CC genotype have the highest diabetic retinopathy risk. In conclusion, our results support an important association of rs507392, rs1617640 and rs551238 minor allele of erythropoietin with increased diabetic retinopathy risk, and additional interaction among three single nucleotide polymorphisms.

We found a significant statistical interaction for rs10468473 with SE alleles in autoantibody-positive RA. Individuals heterozygous for rs10468473 demonstrated higher expression of total MAP2K4 mRNA in blood, compared to A-allele homozygous. We discovered a novel, putatively translated, "cassette exon" RNA splice form of MAP2K4, differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 88 RA cases and controls. Within the group of RA patients, we observed a correlation of MAP2K4 isoform expression with carried SE alleles, autoantibody, and rheumatoid factor profiles. TNF-dependent modulation of isoform expression pattern was detected in the Jurkat cell line. Our data suggest a genetic interaction between MAP2K4 and HLA-DRB1, and the importance of rs10468473 and MAP2K4 splice variants in the development of autoantibody-positive RA. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Some researchers have proposed that the "missing heritability" may be attributable to gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Because there are billions of potential interaction combinations, the statistical power of a single study is often ineffective in detecting these interactions. Meta-analysis is a common method of increasing detection power; however, accessing individual data could be difficult. This study presents a simple method that employs aggregated summary values from a "case" group to detect these specific interactions that based on rare disease and independence assumptions. However, these assumptions, particularly the rare disease assumption, may be violated in real situations; therefore, this study further investigated the robustness of our proposed method when it violates the assumptions. In conclusion, we observed that the rare disease assumption is relatively nonessential, whereas the independence assumption is an essential component. Because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are often unrelated to environmental factors and SNPs on other chromosomes, researchers should use this method to investigate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions when they are unable to obtain detailed individual patient data.

Allelic series of the cereal mildew resistance genes Pm3 and Mia provide an excellent system for genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this opportunity for molecular research, avirulence genes in mildews remain underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B.g, hordei) has shown that the reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific interaction of wheat mildew (B.g. trifler) with the Pm3 allelic series. We found that two mildew genes control avirulence on Pm3f: one gene is involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor/avirulence gene combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will be genetically identified as the "avirulence" gene. Additionally, the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded avirulence genes in B.g, hordei further suggests that the control of avirulence in mildew is more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully understand the mildew cereal interactions, more knowledge on avirulence determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved based on recent advances in the field.

At present, there are an insufficient number of loci suitable for gene knock-in, such as the Rosa26 locus. Therefore, in this study, we developed an efficient strategy for identifying genome loci suitable for gene knock-in and characterized the properties of such loci for gene integration. For efficient discovery and characterization, we constructed a new gene-trapping vector that enables monitoring of the expression of both trapped and integrated genes using fluorescence. We successfully obtained fluorescent-positive mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) clones with the vector. Thorough analysis of the expression of fluorescent proteins in chimera embryos generated with the obtained mESC clones, some of the gene-trapped chimera embryos showed stable and ubiquitous expression of the integrated gene. Furthermore, adult mice derived from one of the gene-trapped mESC clones showed ubiquitous expression of the integrated gene in various tissues without any unusual phenotype. This indicated that the identified locus possesses high potential for foreign gene integration. Our strategy allows for efficient discovery and characterization of mouse genome loci for gene integration.

J	Emily, M				Emily, Mathieu			AGGrEGATOr: A Gene-based GEne-Gene interActTiOn test for case-control association studies	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						gene-gene interaction; genome-wide association; minP	PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORKS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; MISSING HERITABILITY; CO-ASSOCIATION; P VALUES; EPISTASIS; 2-LOCUS; LOCI; FREQUENCIES; SIMULATION	Among the large of number of statistical methods that have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions in case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene-based methods have recently grown in popularity as they confer advantage in both statistical power and biological interpretation. All of the gene-based methods jointly model the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sets prior to the statistical test, leading to a limited power to detect sums of SNP-SNP signals. In this paper, we instead propose a gene-based method that first performs SNP-SNP interaction tests before aggregating the obtained p-values into a test at the gene level. Our method called AGGrEGATOr is based on a minP procedure that tests the significance of the minimum of a set of p-values. We use simulations to assess the capacity of -AGGrEGATOr to correctly control for type-I error. The benefits of our approach in terms of statistical power and robustness to SNPs set characteristics are evaluated in a wide range of disease models by comparing it to previous methods. We also apply our method to detect gene pairs associated to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on the GSE39428 dataset. We identify 13 potential gene-gene interactions and replicate one gene pair in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset at the level of 5%. We further test 15 gene pairs, previously reported as being statistically associated with RA or Crohn's disease (CD) or coronary artery disease (CAD), for replication in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset. We show that AGGrEGATOr is the only method able to successfully replicate seven gene pairs.

Material/Methods: A case-control study of 879 Uyghur patients with T2D and 895 non-diabetic Uyghur controls was conducted at the Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between 2010 and 2013. Eight SNPs in CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B and FTO were analyzed using Sequenom MassARRAY (R) SNP genotyping. Factors associated with T2D were assessed by logistic regression analyses. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were analyzed by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction. Results: Genotype distributions of rs10811661 (CDKN2A/2B), rs7195539, rs8050136, and rs9939609 (FTO) and allele frequencies of rs8050136 and rs9939609 differed significantly between diabetes and control groups (all P<0.05). While rs10811661, rs8050136, and rs9939609 were eliminated after adjusting for covariates (P>0.05), rs7195539 distribution differed significantly in co-dominant and dominant models (P<0.05). In gene-gene interaction analysis, after adjusting for covariates the two-locus rs10811661-rs7195539 interaction model had a cross-validation consistency of 10/10 and the highest balanced accuracy of 0.5483 (P=0.014). In gene-environment interaction analysis, the 3-locus interaction model TG-HDL-family history of diabetes had a cross-validation consistency of 10/10 and the highest balanced accuracy of 0.7072 (P<0.001). The 4-locus interaction model, rs7195539-TG-HDL-family history of diabetes had a cross-validation consistency of 8/10 (P<0.001). Conclusions: Polymorphisms in CDKN2A/2B and FTO, but not CDKAL1, may be associated with T2D, and alleles rs8050136 and rs9939609 are likely risk alleles for T2D in this population. There were potential interactions among CDKN2A/2B (rs10811661) - FTO (rs7195539) or FTO (rs7195539)-TG-HDL-family history of diabetes in the pathogenesis of T2D in a Uyghur population.

Design and testing of a hybrid gene-within-agene construct (composed of a Cas9 gene containing an artificial intron with an inserted sgRNA gene) demonstrated that such constructs were functional both in tobacco cells and C. reinhardtii cells. In tests with C. reinhardtii, approximately one in every similar to 3 x 10(7) initial cells contained an edited version of the targeted FKB12 gene (i.e., an average of similar to 3 colonies with an edited FKB12 gene per electroporation using 10(8) initial cells). Lack of an intact Cas9/intron-sgRNA gene in cells carrying either of two different edited genes strongly suggested that editing was due to transient expression of the Cas9/intron-sgRNA gene and the likely toxicity of long-term expression of Cas9 in C. reinhardtii cells. Co-transformation of the arginine-requiring mutant, arg7-8, with Cas9/intron-sgRNA constructs and appropriately designed synthetic, 80 nucleotide ssDNAs complementary to the argininosuccinate lyase (ARG) gene led to successful homologous recombination or nucleotide replacement and production of arginine prototrophs. As a practical application, a similar ssDNA oligonucleotide targeting the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene and an appropriate Cas9/intron-sgRNA construct was used to create cells resistant to the herbicide, sulfometuron methyl.

J	Hasic, D; Tannier, E				Hasic, Damir; Tannier, Eric			Gene tree species tree reconciliation with gene conversion	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Phylogenetic reconciliation; Gene conversion; Gene duplication; Gene loss; All optimal reconciliations	PHYLOGENETIC TREES; FAMILY EVOLUTION; INFERENCE; EVENTS; DUPLICATION; ALGORITHMS; SEQUENCES; SEX	Gene tree/species tree reconciliation is a recent decisive progress in phylogenetic methods, accounting for the possible differences between gene histories and species histories. Reconciliation consists in explaining these differences by gene-scale events such as duplication, loss, transfer, which translates mathematically into a mapping between gene tree nodes and species tree nodes or branches. Gene conversion is a frequent and important evolutionary event, which results in the replacement of a gene by a copy of another from the same species and in the same gene tree. Including this event in reconciliation models has never been attempted because it introduces a dependency between lineages, and standard algorithms based on dynamic programming become ineffective. We propose here a novel mathematical framework including gene conversion as an evolutionary event in gene tree/species tree reconciliation. We describe a randomized algorithm that finds, in polynomial running time, a reconciliation minimizing the number of duplications, losses and conversions in the case when their weights are equal. We show that the space of optimal reconciliations includes an analog of the last common ancestor reconciliation, but is not limited to it. Our algorithm outputs any optimal reconciliation with a non-null probability. We argue that this study opens a research avenue on including gene conversion in reconciliation, and discuss its possible importance in biology.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a population-based, case-control study comprised of seventh-grade children from 14 Taiwanese communities. A total of 235 asthmatic cases and 1,310 non-asthmatic controls were selected for DNA collection and genotyping. We examined the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions between 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in antioxidative, inflammatory and obesity-related genes, and childhood asthma. Environmental exposures and disease status were obtained from parental questionnaires. The model-free and non-parametrical multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was used for the analysis. A three-way gene-gene interaction was elucidated between the gene coding glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1), the gene coding interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain (IL4Ra) and the gene coding insulin induced gene 2 (INSIG2) on the risk of lifetime asthma. The testing-balanced accuracy on asthma was 57.83% with a cross-validation consistency of 10 out of 10. The interaction of preterm birth and indoor dampness had the highest training-balanced accuracy at 59.09%. Indoor dampness also interacted with many genes, including IL13, beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). We also used likelihood ratio tests for interaction and chi-square tests to validate our results and all tests showed statistical significance. Conclusions/Significance: The results of this study suggest that GSTP1, INSIG2 and IL4Ra may influence the lifetime asthma susceptibility through gene-gene interactions in schoolchildren. Home dampness combined with each one of the genes STAT6, IL13 and ADRB2 could raise the asthma risk.

GSA performs statistical tests for independent microarray samples at the level of gene sets rather than individual genes. Nowadays, an increasing number of microarray studies are conducted to explore the dynamic changes of gene expression in a variety of species and biological scenarios. In these longitudinal studies, gene expression is repeatedly measured over time such that a GSA needs to take into account the within-gene correlations in addition to possible between-gene correlations. Results: We provide a robust nonparametric approach to compare the expressions of longitudinally measured sets of genes under multiple treatments or experimental conditions. The limiting distributions of our statistics are derived when the number of genes goes to infinity while the number of replications can be small. When the number of genes in a gene set is small, we recommend permutation tests based on our nonparametric test statistics to achieve reliable type I error and better power while incorporating unknown correlations between and within-genes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has a greater power than other methods for various data distributions and heteroscedastic correlation structures. This method was used for an IL-2 stimulation study and significantly altered gene sets were identified. Conclusions: The simulation study and the real data application showed that the proposed gene set analysis provides a promising tool for longitudinal microarray analysis. R scripts for simulating longitudinal data and calculating the nonparametric statistics are posted on the North Dakota INBRE vvebsite http://ndinbre.org/programs/bioinformatics.php. Raw microarray data is available in Gene Expression Omnibus (National Center for Biotechnology Information) with accession number G5E6085.

While numerous studies have investigated regulation of expression level, little is known about gene design elements that govern expression costs. Here, we ask how cells minimize production costs while maintaining a given protein expression level and whether there are gene architectures that optimize this process. We measured fitness of similar to 14,000 E. coli strains, each expressing a reporter gene with a unique 5' architecture. By comparing cost-effective and ineffective architectures, we found that cost per protein molecule could be minimized by lowering transcription levels, regulating translation speeds, and utilizing amino acids that are cheap to synthesize and that are less hydrophobic. We then examined natural E. coli genes and found that highly expressed genes have evolved more forcefully to minimize costs associated with their expression. Our study thus elucidates gene design elements that improve the economy of protein expression in natural and heterologous systems.

The broad clinical research activity has been addressed mainly to cancer, primarily to those cancers that do not respond well to conventional treatment. GTMPs to treat rare disorders caused by single-gene mutations have also made important advancements toward market availability, with eye and hematopoietic system diseases as the main applications. Nucleic acid-marketed products are based on both in vivo and ex vivo strategies. Apart from DNA-based therapies, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, and, recently, T-cell-based therapies have been also marketed. Moreover, the gene-editing tool CRISPR is boosting the development of new gene therapybased medicines, and it is expected to have a substantial impact on the gene therapy biopharmaceutical market in the near future. However, despite the important advancements of gene therapy, many challenges have still to be overcome, which are discussed in this book chapter. Issues such as efficacy and safety of the gene delivery systems and manufacturing capacity of biotechnological companies to produce viral vectors are usually considered, but problems related to cost and patient affordability must be also faced to ensure the success of this emerging therapy.

Although a variety of methods can be used to deliver the genetic materials into the target cells and tissues, modified viral vectors represent one of the more common delivery routes because of its transduction efficiency for therapeutic genes. Since the introduction of gene therapy concept in the 1970s, the field has advanced considerably with notable clinical successes being demonstrated in many clinical indications in which no standard treatment options are currently available. It is anticipated that the clinical success the field observed in recent years can drive requirements for more scalable, robust, cost effective, and regulatory-compliant manufacturing processes. This review provides a brief overview of the current manufacturing technologies for viral vectors production, drawing attention to the common upstream and downstream production process platform that is applicable across various classes of viral vectors and their unique manufacturing challenges as compared to other biologics. In addition, a case study of an industry-scale cGMP production of an AAV-based gene therapy product performed at 2,000 L-scale is presented. The experience and lessons learned from this largest viral gene therapy vector production run conducted to date as discussed and highlighted in this review should contribute to future development of commercial viable scalable processes for vial gene therapies.

Many network-based approaches have been used to prioritize disease genes. Many networks, such as the protein-protein interaction (PPI), KEGG, and gene co-expression networks, have been used. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been successfully applied for the determination of genes associated with several diseases. In this study, we constructed an eQTL-based gene-gene co-regulation network (GGCRN) and used it to mine for disease genes. We adopted the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm to mine for genes associated with Alzheimer disease. Compared to the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) PPI network alone, the integrated HPRD PPI and GGCRN networks provided faster convergence and revealed new disease-related genes. Therefore, using the RWR algorithm for integrated PPI and GGCRN is an effective method for disease-associated gene mining. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most gene set analysis methods treat genes equally, regardless how specific they are to a given gene set. Results: In this work we propose a new gene set analysis method that computes a gene set score as the mean of absolute values of weighted moderated gene t-scores. The gene weights are designed to emphasize the genes appearing in few gene sets, versus genes that appear in many gene sets. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method when analyzing gene sets that correspond to the KEGG pathways, and hence we called our method Pathway Analysis with Down-weighting of Overlapping Genes (PADOG). Unlike most gene set analysis methods which are validated through the analysis of 2-3 data sets followed by a human interpretation of the results, the validation employed here uses 24 different data sets and a completely objective assessment scheme that makes minimal assumptions and eliminates the need for possibly biased human assessments of the analysis results. Conclusions: PADOG significantly improves gene set ranking and boosts sensitivity of analysis using information already available in the gene expression profiles and the collection of gene sets to be analyzed. The advantages of PADOG over other existing approaches are shown to be stable to changes in the database of gene sets to be analyzed.

The Influence of Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions on the Risk of Asbestosis	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE; NITRIC-OXIDE; PENTANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; FREE-RADICALS; HUMAN LUNG; MECHANISMS; POLYMORPHISMS; DNA; CARCINOGENESIS; CROCIDOLITE	This study investigated the influence of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on the risk of developing asbestosis. The study comprised 262 cases with asbestosis and 265 controls with no asbestos-related disease previously studied for MnSOD, ECSOD, CAT, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and iNOS polymorphisms. Data on cumulative asbestos and smoking were available for all subjects. To assess gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions, logistic regression was used. The associations between MnSOD Ala -9Val polymorphism and the risk of asbestosis and between iNOS genotypes and asbestosis were modified by CAT -262 C > T polymorphism (P = 0.038; P = 0.031). A strong interaction was found between GSTM1-null polymorphism and smoking (P = 0.007), iNOS (CCTTT)(n) polymorphism and smoking (P = 0.054), and between iNOS (CCTTT)(n) polymorphism and cumulative asbestos exposure (P = 0.037). The findings of this study suggest that the interactions between different genotypes, genotypes and smoking, and between genotypes and asbestos exposure have an important influence on the development of asbestosis and should be seriously considered in future research on occupational/environmental asbestos-related diseases.

However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression "noise," has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.

Nevertheless, no approach has demonstrated efficacy in eradicating this lethal, if untreated, infection. The curative power of gene therapy has been proven for the treatment of monogenic immunodeficiensies, where permanent gene modification of host cells is sufficient to correct the defect for life-time. No doubt, a similar concept is not applicable for gene therapy of infectious immunodeficiensies as AIDS, where there is not a single gene to be corrected; rather engineered cells must gain immunotherapeutic or antiviral features to grant either short-or long-term efficacy mostly by acquisition of antiviral genes or payloads. Anti-HIV/AIDS gene therapy is one of the most promising strategy, although challenging, to eradicate HIV-1 infection. In fact, genetic modification of hematopoietic stem cells with one or multiple therapeutic genes is expected to originate blood cell progenies resistant to viral infection and thereby able to prevail on infected unprotected cells. Ultimately, protected cells will re-establish a functional immune system able to control HIV-1 replication. More than hundred gene therapy clinical trials against AIDS employing different viral vectors and transgenes have been approved or are currently ongoing worldwide. This review will overview anti-HIV-1 infection gene therapy field evaluating strength and weakness of the transgenes and payloads used in the past and of those potentially exploitable in the future.

Measuring gene-gene interaction using Kullback-Leibler divergence	ANNALS OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						case-control study; gene-gene interaction; hypothesis testing; Kullback-Leibler statistic; SNP		Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to investigate genetic variants contributing to complex traits. Despite discovering many loci, a large proportion of "missing" heritability remains unexplained. Gene-gene interactions may help explain some of this gap. Traditionally, gene-gene interactions have been evaluated using parametric statistical methods such as linear and logistic regression, with multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) used to address sparseness of data in high dimensions. We propose a method for the analysis of gene-gene interactions across independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genes. Typical methods for this problem use statistics based on an asymptotic chi-squared mixture distribution, which is not easy to use. Here, we propose a Kullback-Leibler-type statistic, which follows an asymptotic, positive, normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no relationship between SNPs in the two genes, and normally distributed under the alternative hypothesis. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies, which show promising results. The method is also used to analyze real data and identifies gene-gene interactions among RAB3A, MADD, and PTPRN on type 2 diabetes (T2D) status.

J	Shen, Y; Zhang, L				Shen, Ying; Zhang, Lin			Gene function prediction with knowledge from gene ontology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						gene ontology; semantic similarity; distance metric learning; gene function prediction; data mining; bioinformatics	SEMANTIC SIMILARITY; EXPRESSION DATA; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; TAXONOMY	Gene function prediction is an important problem in bioinformatics. Due to the inherent noise existing in the gene expression data, the attempt to improve the prediction accuracy resorting to new classification techniques is limited. With the emergence of Gene Ontology (GO), extra knowledge about the gene products can be extracted from GO and facilitates solving the gene function prediction problem. In this paper, we propose a new method which utilises GO information to improve the classifiers' performance in gene function prediction. Specifically, our method learns a distance metric under the supervision of the GO knowledge using the distance learning technique.

So far, the vast majority of gene therapy clinical trials have exploited viral vectors as very efficient nucleic acid delivery vehicles both in vivo and ex vivo. Here we summarize the current status of viral gene transfer for clinical applications, with special emphasis on the molecular properties of the major classes of viral vectors and the information so far obtained from gene therapy clinical trials.

While considerable attention has been placed on the genetic novelties that duplicates are capable of introducing, and the role that positive selection plays in their early stages of duplicate evolution, much less attention has been given to the potential consequences of ectopic (non-allelic) gene conversion on these evolutionary processes. In this paper we consider the historical origins of ectopic gene conversion models and present a synthesis of the current Drosophila data in light of several primary questions in the field.

The DNA topoisomerases Top1 and Top2 and the HMGB family protein Hmo1 assist DNA replication and transcription(3-6). Here we describe the topological architecture of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. We found under-wound DNA at gene boundaries and over-wound DNA within coding regions. This arrangement does not depend on Pol II or S phase. Top2 and Hmo1 preserve negative supercoil at gene boundaries, while Top1 acts at coding regions. Transcription generates RNA-DNA hybrids within coding regions, independently of fork orientation. During S phase, Hmo1 protects under-wound DNA from Top2, while Top2 confines Pol II and Top1 at coding units, counteracting transcription leakage and aberrant hybrids at gene boundaries. Negative supercoil at gene boundaries prevents supercoil diffusion and nucleosome repositioning at coding regions. DNA looping occurs at Top2 clusters. We propose that Hmo1 locks gene boundaries in a cruciform conformation and, with Top2, modulates the architecture of genes that retain the memory of the topological arrangements even when transcription is repressed. The topoisomerase Top2 and the chromatin-binding protein Hmo1 maintain under-wound and over-wound DNA at different regions within a gene and thereby modulate the topology of genes.

We adopted genome-wide sequencing methods to screen for susceptibility genes involved in gene-mediated metabolic pathways from the perspective of manganese poisoning. We identified 18,439 genes in this study, including 14,272 known genes and 4398 new genes. We then selected 17 differential genes using p values, of which 7 genes were down-regulated and 10 genes were up-regulated. Possible interaction genes for each differential gene were selected according to the String database. Sgk1, HCRTr1, HspB1, Rem2, Oprd1, ATF5, and TRHr identified in this study may be involved in oxidative stress mechanisms, dopamine (DA) synthesis, and neuronal survival during apoptosis and may affect susceptibility to manganese poisoning.

On the other hand, classic genetic analysis relies on the availability of loss-offunction or gain-of-function mutants. The fast development of genome editing technologies such as TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 has greatly facilitated the generation of null mutants for the functional studies of target genes in a variety of organisms such as zebrafish. Surprisingly, an unexpected discrepancy was observed between morphant phenotype and mutant phenotype for many genes in zebrafish, i.e., while the morphant often displays an obvious phenotype, the corresponding null mutant appears relatively normal or only exhibits a mild phenotype due to gene compensation. Two recent reports have partially answered this intriguing question by showing that a pre-mature termination codon and homologous sequence are required to elicit the gene compensation and the histone modifying complex COMPASS is involved in activating the expression of the compensatory genes. Here, I summarize these exciting new progress and try to redefine the concept of genetic compensation and gene compensation.

One approach involves treating mutant RNA through antisense oligonucleotides; the first drug has received regulatory approval to treat specific mutations associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gene editing is being evaluated in the preclinical setting. For inherited cardiomyopathies, genetic correction strategies require tight specificity for the mutant allele. Gene-editing methods are being tested to create deletions that may be useful to restore protein expression through the bypass of mutations that restore protein production. Site-specific gene editing, which is required to correct many point mutations, is a less efficient process than inducing deletions.

Which prokaryotic heritage predominates? Here, we have clustered 19,050,992 protein sequences from 5,443 bacteria and 212 archaea with 3,420,731 protein sequences from 150 eukaryotes spanning six eukaryotic supergroups. By downsampling, we obtain estimates for the bacterial and archaeal proportions. Eukaryotic genomes possess a bacterial majority of genes. On average, the majority of bacterial genes is 56% overall, 53% in eukaryotes that never possessed plastids, and 61% in photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages, where the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids contributed additional genes to the eukaryotic lineage. Intracellularparasites, whichundergoreductive evolution inadaptationtothenutrient richenvironmentof the cells that they infect, relinquish bacterial genes for metabolic processes. Such adaptive gene loss is most pronounced in the human parasite Encephalitozoon intestinalis with 86% archaeal and 14% bacterial derived genes. The most bacterial eukaryote genome sampled is rice, with 67% bacterial and 33% archaeal genes. The functional dichotomy, initially described for yeast, of archaeal genes being involved in genetic information processing and bacterial genes being involved inmetabolic processes is conserved across all eukaryotic supergroups.

Studies and safety works demonstrated the potential therapeutic efficacy and safety of this approach, providing the rationale for clinical translation. The outcomes of early clinical trials, although showing promising results, have highlighted the current limitations to a more general application. These include the nature, source and age of repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, the suboptimal transduction efficiency and gene expression levels, the toxicity and efficacy of bone marrow conditioning, the stress status of bone marrow microenvironment in chronic diseases such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Recently, gene editing strategies based on the use of nucleases offered a novel approach to increase globin expression in a quasi-physiological way, independently from the addition of transgenes and viral sequences to the human genome. This review will discuss the current status of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease with a perspective towards the improvements necessary in the context of clinical translation.

J	Li, WR; Wang, M; Sun, JH; Wang, Y; Jiang, R				Li, Wenran; Wang, Meng; Sun, Jinghao; Wang, Yong; Jiang, Rui			Gene co-opening network deciphers gene functional relationships	MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article							CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY; EXPRESSION; PSORIASIS; GENOME; INTERACTOME; WALKING; TRANSCRIPTION; ENCYCLOPEDIA; DISCOVERY	Genome sequencing technology has generated a vast amount of genomic and epigenomic data, and has provided us a great opportunity to study gene functions on a global scale from an epigenomic view. In the last decade, network-based studies, such as those based on PPI networks and co-expression networks, have shown good performance in capturing functional relationships between genes. However, the functions of a gene and the mechanism of interaction of genes with each other to elucidate their functions are still not entirely clear. Here, we construct a gene co-opening network based on chromatin accessibility of genes. We show that genes related to a specific biological process or the same disease tend to be clustered in the co-opening network. This understanding allows us to detect functional clusters from the network and to predict new functions for genes. We further apply the network to prioritize disease genes for Psoriasis, and demonstrate the power of the joint analysis of the co-opening network and GWAS data in identifying disease genes. Taken together, the co-opening network provides a new viewpoint for the elucidation of gene associations and the interpretation of disease mechanisms.

Gene-gene interaction filtering with ensemble of filters	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC)	JAN 11-14, 2011	Incheon, SOUTH KOREA				FEATURE-SELECTION; WIDE ASSOCIATION; EPISTASIS; RELIEFF; SNPS	Background: Complex diseases are commonly caused by multiple genes and their interactions with each other. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies provide us the opportunity to capture those disease associated genes and gene-gene interactions through panels of SNP markers. However, a proper filtering procedure is critical to reduce the search space prior to the computationally intensive gene-gene interaction identification step. In this study, we show that two commonly used SNP-SNP interaction filtering algorithms, ReliefF and tuned ReliefF (TuRF), are sensitive to the order of the samples in the dataset, giving rise to unstable and suboptimal results. However, we observe that the 'unstable' results from multiple runs of these algorithms can provide valuable information about the dataset. We therefore hypothesize that aggregating results from multiple runs of the algorithm may improve the filtering performance. Results: We propose a simple and effective ensemble approach in which the results from multiple runs of an unstable filter are aggregated based on the general theory of ensemble learning. The ensemble versions of the ReliefF and TuRF algorithms, referred to as ReliefF-E and TuRF-E, are robust to sample order dependency and enable a more informative investigation of data characteristics. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that both the ensemble of ReliefF and the ensemble of TuRF can generate a much more stable SNP ranking than the original algorithms. Furthermore, the ensemble of TuRF achieved the highest success rate in comparison to many state-of-the-art algorithms as well as traditional chi(2)-test and odds ratio methods in terms of retaining gene-gene interactions.

Keystone Genes	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Review							ECOSYSTEM GENETICS; EVOSYSTEM SERVICES; LOCAL ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION; PLANT; COMMUNITY; SELECTION; DYNAMICS; GENOTYPE; ECOLOGY	The keystone species concept is used in ecology to describe individual species with disproportionately large effects on their communities. We extend this idea to the level of genes with disproportionately large effects on ecological processes. Such 'keystone genes' (KGs) would underlie traits involved in species interactions or causing critical biotic and/or abiotic changes that influence emergent community and ecosystem properties. We propose a general framework for how KGs could be identified, while keeping KGs under the umbrella of 'ecologically important genes' (EIGs) that also include categories such as 'foundation genes', 'ecosystem engineering genes', and more. Although likely rare, KGs and other EIGs could dominate certain ecological processes; thus, their discovery and study are relevant for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics.

We consider as well the broad range of social conditions that render genetic knowledge salient in clinical settings and for population health. This sociological analysis of genetic knowledge highlights how genetic knowledge flourishes and shapes social environments and how in turn environments select for particular forms of genetic knowledge. We examine the role of the laboratory, regulatory state, and social movements in the production of genetic knowledge and the clinic, family, and population health as critical sites where genetic knowledge becomes actionable.

Methods: The study was performed with the following steps: 1) Selected the previously discovered narcolepsy risk genes through literature review, 2) pathway enrichment analysis, and construction of gene-gene and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for narcolepsy. Results: 1) GO analysis revealed the positive regulation of interferon-gamma production as the most enriched terms in biological process, and C-C chemokine receptor activity as the most enriched term in molecular function, 2) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed selective enrichment of genes in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways, and 3) five hub genes were identified (IFNAR1, IL10RB, DNMT1, TNFSF4 and NFATC2). Conclusion: The bioinformatics results provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of narcolepsy and the identification of potential therapeutic targets for narcolepsy treatment.

Our approach (i) integrates the advantages of the tetracycline (Tet)-controlled transcriptional silencer tTS(Kid) and the self-cleaving 2A peptide bridge, (ii) combines essential regulatory components as an autoregulatory loop, (iii) simplifies the gene delivery scheme, and (iv) regulates multiple genes in a synchronized manner. Controlled by an upstream let-responsive element (IRE), both the ubiquitous chicken beta-actin promoter (CAG) and the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Syn) could regulate expression of tTS(Kid) together with two 2A-linked reporter genes. Transduction in vitro exhibited maximally 50-fold regulation by doxycycline (Dox). Determined by gene delivery method as well as promoter, highly specific tissues were transduced in vivo. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) visualized reversible "ON/OFF" gene switches over repeated "Doxy-Cycling" in living mice. Thus, the reversible rAAV-mediated N-cistronic gene expression system, termed RANGE, may serve as a versatile tool to achieve reversible polycistronic gene regulation for the study of gene function as well as gene therapy.

J	Deng, WQ; Pare, G				Deng, Wei Q.; Pare, Guillaume			A Fast Algorithm to Optimize SNP Prioritization for Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						variance prioritization; heterogeneity of variance; Bonferroni correction; quantitative trait	WIDE ASSOCIATION; POWER	Detection of gene-environment interactions using an exhaustive search necessarily raises the multiple hypothesis problem. While frequently used to control for experiment-wise type I error, Bonferroni correction is overly conservative and results in reduced statistical power. We have previously shown that prioritizing SNPs on the basis of heterogeneity in quantitative trait variance per genotype leads to increased power to detect genetic interactions. Our proposed method, variance prioritization (VP), selects SNPs having significant heterogeneity in variance per genotype using a pre-determined P-value threshold. We now suggest prioritizing SNPs individually such that the optimal heterogeneity of variance P-value is determined for each SNP. The large number of SNPs in genome-wide studies calls for a fast algorithm to output the optimal prioritization threshold for each SNP. In this report, we present such an algorithm, the Gene Environment Wide Interaction Search Threshold (GEWIST), and show that the use of GEWIST will increase power under a variety of interaction scenarios. Furthermore, by integrating over possible interaction effect sizes, we provide a framework to optimize prioritization in situations where interactions are a priori unknown. Genet.

J	Feng, P; Liu, ZJ				Feng, Ping; Liu, Zhijun			Complex gene expansion of the CYP2D gene subfamily	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						CYP2D subfamily; diet; evolution; gene expansion; P450	CYTOCHROME-P450 GENES; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; IDENTIFICATION; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION; ENZYMES; MONKEY; MOUSE; LIVER; TREE	Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily genes encode enzymes that play a role in metabolizing endogenous compounds and in detoxifying exogenous chemicals. The CYP2D subfamily is a member of the CYP2 family, and its gene expansion in herbivores is presumably linked with the need to detoxify abundant plant toxins in the diet, which indicates that CYP2D gene expansion is associated with dietary preferences. To test this hypothesis, the dietary information and CYP2D gene number for 73 vertebrates from different taxonomic groups including 22 mammals, 49 birds, 1 reptile, and 1 amphibian were collected, and correlation analysis and ANOVA were conducted. The results showed that most species (45/73) had only one CYP2D gene, despite their different diets, and dietary preferences were not correlated with CYP2D gene numbers. Specifically, the majority of birds and 7 mammals had only 1 CYP2D gene, and the CYP2D gene number of mammals ranged from 1 to 11, irrespective of their feeding habits. Species with a CYP2D gene number >= 5 included carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. Furthermore, statistical analyses revealed that no significant correlation existed between dietary preferences and CYP2D gene number, and there was no significant CYP2D gene number variation among species with different dietary preferences, regardless of whether all vertebrates or specific lineages were considered. Furthermore, gene dynamics which indicated by gene duplication events and loss events showed that CYP2D gene number variation had no relationship with diet, suggesting that diet was not a driving force of CYP2D gene expansion and that CYP2D gene expansion was more complex than previously recognized.

Components of the developmental, sensing, and effector pathways, functioning in multiple cell types, were detected by infecting 22,000 G3 mutant mice with MCMV at an inoculum easily contained by WT animals.

The eradication of HIV in the so-called "Berlin patient" who received a bone marrow transplant from a CCR5-negative donor has rekindled interest in genome engineering strategies to achieve the same effect. Precise gene editing within the cells is now a realistic possibility with recent advances in understanding the DNA repair mechanisms, DNA interaction with transcription factors and bacterial defense mechanisms. Within the past few years, four novel technologies have emerged that can be engineered for recognition of specific DNA target sequences to enable site-specific gene editing: Homing Endonuclease, ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9 system. The most recent CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short stretch of complementary RNA bound to Cas9 nuclease to recognize and cleave target DNA, as opposed to the previous technologies that use DNA binding motifs of either zinc finger proteins or transcription activator-like effector molecules fused to an endonuclease to mediate sequence-specific DNA cleavage. Unlike RNA interference, which requires the continued presence of effector moieties to maintain gene silencing, the newer technologies allow permanent disruption of the targeted gene after a single treatment. Here, we review the applications, limitations and future prospects of novel gene-editing strategies for use as HIV therapy.

Identifying disease genes using machine learning and gene functional similarities, assessed through Gene Ontology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEMANTIC SIMILARITY	Identifying disease genes from a vast amount of genetic data is one of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era. Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

This is, however, in contrast to what we know about the lack of autonomy between neighboring genes in gene expression profiles in extant taxa. Indeed, in all eukaryotic genomes genes of similar expression-profile tend to cluster, reflecting chromatin level dynamics. Does it follow that if a gene increases expression in a particular lineage then the genomic neighbors will also increase in their expression or is gene expression evolution autonomous? To address this here we consider evolution of human gene expression since the human-chimp common ancestor, allowing for both variation in estimation of current expression level and error in Bayesian estimation of the ancestral state. We find that in all tissues and both sexes, the change in gene expression of a focal gene on average predicts the change in gene expression of neighbors. The effect is highly pronounced in the immediate vicinity (<100 kb) but extends much further. Sex-specific expression change is also genomically clustered. As genes increasing their expression in humans tend to avoid nuclear lamina domains and be enriched for the gene activator 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, we conclude that, most probably owing to chromatin level control of gene expression, a change in gene expression of one gene likely affects the expression evolution of neighbors, what we term expression piggybacking, an analog of hitchhiking.

The commonly adopted marginal analysis is limited by considering only a small number of G factors at a time. With the main effects, interactions hierarchical constraint, many of the existing joint analysis methods suffer from prohibitively high computational cost. In this study, we propose a new method for identifying important GxG interactions under joint modeling. The proposed method adopts tensor regression to accommodate high data dimensionality and the penalization technique for selection. It naturally accommodates the strong hierarchical structure without imposing additional constraints, making optimization much simpler and faster than in the existing studies. It outperforms multiple alternatives in simulation. The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on lung cancer and melanoma demonstrates that it can identify markers with important implications and better prediction performance.

To identify GRNs, time-course gene expression data are widely used. However, the identification is hampered by intrinsic attributes of the data such as small sample size, a large number of variables, and complex error structures with high variation. Under this situation, most GRN inference methods utilize point estimators or make numerous assumptions that are often incompatible with the experimental data. Moreover, different inference methods often provide inconsistent results. An alternative to alleviate this problem can be the bootstrap method because it provides more reliable outcomes by integrating results from multiple bootstrap samples without any distributional assumptions. In this study, we propose a bootstrap method for dependent time-course gene expression data and we mainly focus on its application to gene relevance networks. The proposed method is applied to gene networks for zebrafish retina.

Development of the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method provides a practicable solution to problems in detection of interactions. To exploit the opportunities brought by the availability of diverse data, it is in high demand to develop the corresponding GMDR software that can handle a breadth of phenotypes, such as continuous, count, dichotomous, polytomous nominal, ordinal, survival and multivariate, and various kinds of study designs, such as unrelated case-control, family-based and pooled unrelated and family samples, and also allows adjustment for covariates. We developed a versatile GMDR package to implement this serial of GMDR analyses for various scenarios (e.g., unified analysis of unrelated and family samples) and large-scale (e.g., genome-wide) data. This package includes other desirable features such as data management and preprocessing. Permutation testing strategies are also built in to evaluate the threshold or empirical p values. In addition, its performance is scalable to the computational resources.

J	Xing, PW; Chen, Y; Gao, J; Bai, LY; Yuan, ZM				Xing, Pengwei; Chen, Yuan; Gao, Jun; Bai, Lianyang; Yuan, Zheming			A fast approach to detect gene-gene synergy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EXPRESSION; GROWTH	Selecting informative genes, including individually discriminant genes and synergic genes, from expression data has been useful for medical diagnosis and prognosis. Detecting synergic genes is more difficult than selecting individually discriminant genes. Several efforts have recently been made to detect gene-gene synergies, such as dendrogram-based I(X-1; X-2; Y) (mutual information), doublets (gene pairs) and MIC(X-1; X-2; Y) based on the maximal information coefficient. It is unclear whether dendrogram-based I(X-1; X-2; Y) and doublets can capture synergies efficiently. Although MIC(X-1; X-2; Y) can capture a wide range of interaction, it has a high computational cost triggered by its 3-D search. In this paper, we developed a simple and fast approach based on abs conversion type (i.e. Z = vertical bar X-1-X-2 vertical bar) and t-test, to detect interactions in simulation and real-world datasets. Our results showed that dendrogram-based I(X-1; X-2; Y) and doublets are helpless for discovering pair-wise gene interactions, our approach can discover typical pair-wise synergic genes efficiently. These synergic genes can reach comparable accuracy to the individually discriminant genes using the same number of genes. Classifier cannot learn well if synergic genes have not been converted properly. Combining individually discriminant and synergic genes can improve the prediction performance.

As the other cancers, mutations of tumor suppressor genes that involved in suppression of cell growth are observed in pancreatic cancers. ING4 protein is one of the proteins involved in the regulation of p53 tumor suppressor gene functions. ING4 involved in suppression of cell proliferation, chromosome rearrangement, cell migration, and angiogenesis. In this study, gene expressions and splicing variants of ING4 gene were investigated. Fresh tumor and normal specimens of the same pancreatic cancer patients were used. Gene expression study carried out by calculating the brightness of the bands on agarose gel and splicing variants were detected by direct sequencing. According to the results, three splice forms of ING4 and a decrease in gene expression of ING4 were determined. Splicing type of ING4 affects the translocation of ING4 proteins into the nucleus. To determine the gene expression of each splicing variant, will further clarify the role of ING4 in pancreatic cancers.

Several strategies are used to learn what these apparently dispensable genes contribute to fitness. Assays of growth under hundreds of physical and chemical stresses are among the most effective experimental approaches. Comparative studies of genomic DNA sequences continue to be valuable in discriminating between the core bacterial genome and the more variable niche-specific genes. The concept of the core genome appears currently unfeasible for eukaryotes but progress has been made in understanding why they contain numerous gene duplicates.

Gene therapy strategies involve gene manipulation on broad biological processes responsible for the spreading of diseases. Cancer, monogenic diseases, vascular and infectious diseases are the main targets of gene therapy. In order to obtain valuable experimental and clinical results, sufficient gene transfer methods are required. Therapeutic genes can be administered into target tissues via gene carriers commonly defined as vectors. The retroviral, adenoviral and adeno-associated virus based vectors are most frequently used in the clinic. So far, gene preparations may be administered directly into target organs or by intravenous, intramuscular, intratumor or intranasal injections. It is common knowledge that the number of gene therapy clinical trials has rapidly increased. However, some limitations such as transfection efficiency and stable and long-term gene expression are still not resolved. Consequently, great effort is focused on the evaluation of new strategies of gene delivery. There are many expectations associated with intranasal delivery of gene preparations for the treatment of diseases. Intranasal delivery of therapeutic genes is regarded as one of the most promising forms of pulmonary gene therapy research. Gene therapy based on inhalation of gene preparations offers an alternative way for the treatment of patients suffering from such lung diseases as cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin defect, or cancer. Experimental and first clinical trials based on plasmid vectors or recombinant viruses have revealed that gene preparations can effectively deliver therapeutic or marker genes to the cells of the respiratory tract. The noninvasive intranasal delivery of gene preparations or conventional drugs seems to be very encouraging, although basic scientific research still has to continue (Adv Clin Exp Med 2012, 21, 4, 525-534).

We also investigated the potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as well as their association with ATDH development in a population of hospitalized TB patients from Buenos Aires. Patients and methods We investigated 364 TB patients who received anti-TB drugs. Physicians collected demographic and clinical data to identify environmental risk factors for ATDH development. Polymorphisms were detected using gene sequencing, PCR, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. A binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to compare the results of TB patients with and without the development of hepatotoxicity. The multifactor dimensionality reduction method was used to examine genetic and environmental interactions in association with ATDH. Results This study suggests that the slow acetylator profile [odds ratio (OR): 3.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.82-5.00; P< 0.001], genotypes carrying the c2 variant (OR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.33-3.51; P= 0.002) or the A4 variant of CYP2E1 (OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.06-4.29; P= 0.050), and female sex (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.20-3.14; P= 0.006) were independent predictor variables for ATDH. Patients carrying the slow acetylator profile and the c2 variant showed an increased risk (OR: 7.068; 95% CI: 3.34-14.95; P< 0.001). We also identified a synergic interaction (epistasis) between GSTT1 and CYP2E1 associated with an increased risk for ATDH. A meaningful gene-environment interaction was associated with an increased risk of ATDH [testing balance accuracy= 0.675 (P= 0.001) and cross-validation consistency= 10/10]. Conclusion ATDH is a severe and prevalent adverse drug reaction and leads to drug discontinuation in 11% of TB patients. Our study created a prediction model that properly classified the 67.5% of TB patients in their risk of developing ATDH. The considerable number of TB patients in our country supports the use of pharmacogenetic testing and a comprehensive clinical history to identify patients with a high risk of suffering hepatotoxicity.

J	Dudbridge, F; Fletcher, O				Dudbridge, Frank; Fletcher, Olivia			Gene-Environment Dependence Creates Spurious Gene-Environment Interaction	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							SAMPLE-SIZE REQUIREMENTS; ASSOCIATION; CANCER; MISCLASSIFICATION; MENARCHE; MODELS; CYP3A; BIAS; AGE	Gene-environment interactions have the potential to shed light on biological processes leading to disease and to improve the accuracy of epidemiological risk models. However, relatively few such interactions have yet been confirmed. In part this is because genetic markers such as tag SNPs are usually studied, rather than the causal variants themselves. Previous work has shown that this leads to substantial loss of power and increased sample size when gene and environment are independent. However, dependence between gene and environment can arise in several ways including mediation, pleiotropy, and confounding, and several examples of gene-environment interaction under gene-environment dependence have recently been published. Here we show that under gene-environment dependence, a statistical interaction can be present between a marker and environment even if there is no interaction between the causal variant and the environment. We give simple conditions under which there is no marker-environment interaction and note that they do not hold in general when there is gene-environment dependence. Furthermore, the gene-environment dependence applies to the causal variant and cannot be assessed from marker data. Gene-gene interactions are susceptible to the same problem if two causal variants are in linkage disequilibrium. In addition to existing concerns about mechanistic interpretations, we suggest further caution in reporting interactions for genetic markers.

The micro-scaled environment within microfluidic systems enables precise control and optimization of multiple processes and techniques used in gene transfection and the production of gene and drug transporters. Traditional non-viral gene transfection methods, such as electroporation, microinjection and optical gene transfection, are improved from the use of innovative microfluidic systems. Additionally, microfluidic systems have also made the production of many viral and non-viral vectors controlled, automated, and reproducible. In summary, the development and application of microfluidic systems are producing increased efficiency in gene delivery and promise improved gene therapy results.

Biomarkers that anticipate susceptibility, prognosis, or response to treatments are much needed. Oral cancer is a polygenic disease involving complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors, which require multifaceted analyses. Here, we examined in a dataset of 103 oral cancer cases and 98 controls from Taiwan the association between oral cancer risk and the DNA repair genes X-ray repair cross-complementing group (XRCCs) 1-4, and the environmental factors of smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid (BQ) chewing. We employed logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), and hierarchical interaction graphs for analyzing gene-gene (GxG) and gene-environment (GxE) interactions. We identified a significantly elevated risk of the XRCC2 rs2040639 heterozygous variant among smokers [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-12.1] and alcohol drinkers [adjusted OR=5.7, 95% CI=1.4-23.2]. The best two-factor based GxG interaction of oral cancer included the XRCC1 rs1799782 and XRCC2 rs2040639 [OR=3.13, 95% CI=1.66-6.13]. For the GxE interaction, the estimated OR of oral cancer for two (drinking-BQ chewing), three (XRCC1-XRCC2-BQ chewing), four (XRCC1-XRCC2-age-BQ chewing), and five factors (XRCC1-XRCC2-age-drinking-BQ chewing) were 32.9 [95% CI=14.1-76.9], 31.0 [95% CI=14.0-64.7], 49.8 [95% CI=21.0-117.7] and 82.9 [95% CI=31.0-221.5], respectively. Taken together, the genotypes of XRCC1 rs1799782 and XRCC2 rs2040639 DNA repair genes appear to be significantly associated with oral cancer. These were enhanced by exposure to certain environmental factors. The observations presented here warrant further research in larger study samples to examine their relevance for routine clinical care in oncology.

However, due to lack of experimental information, this analysis is not fully applicable. The aim of this study is to reveal the multi-potent contribution of statistical network inference methods in highlighting significant genes and interactions. We have investigated the ability of statistical co-expression networks to highlight and prioritize genes for breast cancer subtypes and stages in terms of: (i) classification efficiency, (ii) gene network pattern conservation, (iii) indication of involved molecular mechanisms and (iv) systems level momentum to drug repurposing pipelines. We have found that statistical network inference methods are advantageous in gene prioritization, are capable to contribute to meaningful network signature discovery, give insights regarding the disease-related mechanisms and boost drug discovery pipelines from a systems point of view.

In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling genegene and geneenvironment interactions with repeated measures data on a quantitative trait. We review possibilities of using classical models proposed by Tukey (1949) and Mandel (1961) using the cell means of a two-way classification array for such data. Although these models are effective for detecting interactions in the presence of main effects, they fail miserably if the interaction structure is misspecified. We explore a more robust class of interaction models that are based on a singular value decomposition of the cell-means residual matrix after fitting the additive main effect terms. This class of additive main effects and multiplicative interaction models (Gollob, 1968) provide useful summaries for subject-specific and time-varying effects as represented in terms of their contribution to the leading eigenvalues of the interaction matrix. It also makes the interaction structure more amenable to geometric representation. We call this analysis principal interactions analysis. While the paper primarily focuses on a cell-mean-based analysis of repeated measures outcome, we also introduce resampling-based methods that appropriately recognize the unbalanced and longitudinal nature of the data instead of reducing the response to cell means. We illustrate the proposed methods by using data from the Normative Aging Study, a longitudinal cohort study of Boston area veterans since 1963. We carry out simulation studies under an array of classical interaction models and common epistasis models to illustrate the properties of the principal interactions analysis procedure in comparison with the classical alternatives.

Brief isoflurane anaesthesia affects differential gene expression, gene ontology and gene networks in rat brain	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Brain; Rat; Isoflurane; Network; Gene; Anaesthesia	RELEASE MACHINERY; PROTEIN; HYBRIDIZATION; ASSOCIATION; VALIDATION; ACTIVATION; HALOTHANE; MICE	Much is still unknown about the mechanisms of effects of even brief anaesthesia on the brain and previous studies have simply compared differential expression profiles with and without anaesthesia. We hypothesised that network analysis, in addition to the traditional differential gene expression and ontology analysis, would enable identification of the effects of anaesthesia on interactions between genes. Rats (n = 10 per group) were randomised to anaesthesia with isoflurane in oxygen or oxygen only for 15 min, and 6 h later brains were removed. Differential gene expression and gene ontology analysis of micro-array data was performed. Standard clustering techniques and principal component analysis with Bayesian rules were used along with social network analysis methods, to quantitatively model and describe the gene networks. Anaesthesia had marked effects on genes in the brain with differential regulation of 416 probe sets by at least 2 fold. Gene ontology analysis showed 23 genes were functionally related to the anaesthesia and of these, 12 were involved with neurotransmitter release, transport and secretion. Gene network analysis revealed much greater connectivity in genes from brains from anaesthetised rats compared to controls. Other importance measures were also altered after anaesthesia; median [range] closeness centrality (shortest path) was lower in anaesthetized animals (0.07 [0-0.30]) than controls (039 [0.30-0.53], p < 0.0001) and betweenness centrality was higher (53.85 132.56-70.00]% compared to 5.93 [0-30.65]%, p < 0.0001). Simply studying the actions of individual components does not fully describe dynamic and complex systems. Network analysis allows insight into the interactions between genes after anaesthesia and suggests future targets for investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fu, GF; Dai, XT; Symanzik, U; Bushman, S				Fu, Guifang; Dai, Xiaotian; Symanzik, Urgen; Bushman, Shaun			Quantitative gene-gene and gene-environment mapping for leaf shape variation using tree-based models	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						gene-environment; gene-gene; leaf shape; quantitative genetic shape mapping; radius-centroid-contour; random forests	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; RANDOM FORESTS; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; SIZE; ATTRIBUTES; ALLOMETRY; CLIMATE; LEAVES	Leaf shape traits have long been a focus of many disciplines, but the complex genetic and environmental interactive mechanisms regulating leaf shape variation have not yet been investigated in detail. The question of the respective roles of genes and environment and how they interact to modulate leaf shape is a thorny evolutionary problem, and sophisticated methodology is needed to address it. In this study, we investigated a framework-level approach that inputs shape image photographs and genetic and environmental data, and then outputs the relative importance ranks of all variables after integrating shape feature extraction, dimension reduction, and tree-based statistical models. The power of the proposed framework was confirmed by simulation and a Populus szechuanica var. tibetica data set. This new methodology resulted in the detection of novel shape characteristics, and also confirmed some previous findings. The quantitative modeling of a combination of polygenetic, plastic, epistatic, and gene-environment interactive effects, as investigated in this study, will improve the discernment of quantitative leaf shape characteristics, and the methods are ready to be applied to other leaf morphology data sets. Unlike the majority of approaches in the quantitative leaf shape literature, this framework-level approach is data-driven, without assuming any pre-known shape attributes, landmarks, or model structures.

Our previous study has found gene-gene interactions on asthma between these genes in Chinese Han children. Whether the interactions begin in fetal stage, and whether these genes interact with prenatal environment to enhance cord blood IgE (CBIgE) levels and then cause subsequent allergic diseases have yet to be determined. This study aimed to determine whether there are gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on CBIgE elevation among the aforementioned five genes and prenatal environmental factors in Chinese Han population. Methods 989 cord blood samples from a Chinese birth cohort were genotyped for nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the five genes, and measured for CBIgE levels. Prenatal environmental factors were collected using a questionnaire. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were analyzed with generalized multifactor dimensionality methods. Results A four-way gene-gene interaction model (IL13 rs20541, IL13 rs1800925, IL4 rs2243250 and ADRB2 rs1042713) was regarded as the optimal one for CBIgE elevation (testing balanced accuracy = 0.5805, P = 9.03 x 10(-4)). Among the four SNPs, only IL13 rs20541 was identified to have an independent effect on elevated CBIgE (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, P = 3.57 x 10(-3)), while the other three had small but synergistic effects. Carriers of IL13 rs20541 TT, IL13 rs1800925 CT/TT, IL4 rs2243250 TT and ADRB2 rs1042713 AA were estimated to be at more than fourfold higher risk for CBIgE elevation (OR = 4.14, P = 2.69 x 10(-2)). Gene-environment interaction on elevated CBIgE was found between IL4 rs2243250 and maternal atopy (OR = 1.41, P = 2.65 x 10(-2)). Conclusions Gene-gene interaction between IL13 rs20541, IL13 rs1800925, IL4 rs2243250 and ADRB2 rs1042713, and gene-environment interaction between IL4 rs2243250 and maternal atopy begin in prenatal stage to augment IgE production in Chinese Han children.

Four SNPs (rs3132584, rs3130685, rs2222896, and rs2548861) were genotyped in unrelated subjects with normal lipid levels (864) or dyslipidemia (1129). While 5.0% of Maonan subjects carried the rs3132584TT genotype, none of the Chinese Han in Beijing subjects did. Allele and genotype frequencies differed between the normal and dyslipidemia groups for three SNPs (rs3132584, rs3130685, and rs2222896). rs2222896G allele carriers in the normal group had higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The rs3132584GG, rs3130685CC+TT, and rs2222896GG genotypes as well as the rs2222896G-rs2548861G and rs2222896G-rs2548861T haplotypes were associated with an elevated risk of dyslipidemia; the rs2222896Ars2548861T and rs2222896A-rs2548861G haplotypes were associated with a reduced risk of dyslipidemia. Among the thirteen TUBB-WWOX interaction types identified, rs3132584T-rs3130685T-rs2222896G-rs2548861T increased the risk of dyslipidemia 1.371-fold. Fourteen twoto four-locus optimal interactive models for SNP SNP, haplotype-haplotype, gene-gene, and gene-environment interactions exhibited synergistic or contrasting effects on dyslipidemia. Finally, the interaction between rs3132584 and rs2222896 increased the risk of dyslipidemia 2.548-fold and predicted hypertension.

Generally, the gene-based methods can be more powerful than SNP-based methods. Some gene-based entropy methods can only capture the linear relationship between genes. We therefore proposed a nonparametric gene-based information gain method (GBIGM) that can capture both linear relationship and nonlinear correlation between genes. Through simulation with different odds ratio, sample size and prevalence rate, GBIGM was shown to be valid and more powerful than classic KCCU method and SNP-based entropy method. In the analysis of data from 17 genes on rheumatoid arthritis, GBIGM was more effective than the other two methods as it obtains fewer significant results, which was important for biological verification. Therefore, GBIGM is a suitable and powerful tool for detecting GGIs in case-control studies.

We provide an overview on the structure and composition of the plastid genome of land plants as well as the functions of its genes in an explicit phylogenetic and evolutionary context. We will discuss the architecture of land plant plastid chromosomes, including gene content and synteny across land plants. Moreover, we will explore the functions and roles of plastid encoded genes in metabolism and their evolutionary importance regarding gene retention and conservation. We suggest that the slow mode at which the plastome typically evolves is likely to be influenced by a combination of different molecular mechanisms. These include the organization of plastid genes in operons, the usually uniparental mode of plastid inheritance, the activity of highly effective repair mechanisms as well as the rarity of plastid fusion. Nevertheless, structurally rearranged plastomes can be found in several unrelated lineages (e.g. ferns, Pinaceae, multiple angiosperm families). Rearrangements and gene losses seem to correlate with an unusual mode of plastid transmission, abundance of repeats, or a heterotrophic lifestyle (parasites or myco-heterotrophs). While only a few functional gene gains and more frequent gene losses have been inferred for land plants, the plastid Ndh complex is one example of multiple independent gene losses and will be discussed in detail. Patterns of ndh-gene loss and functional analyses indicate that these losses are usually found in plant groups with a certain degree of heterotrophy, might rendering plastid encoded Ndh1 subunits dispensable.

While scRNA-seq measures thousands of genes, researchers are often interested in only dozens to hundreds of genes for a closer study. Then, a question is how to select those informative genes from scRNA-seq data. Moreover, single-cell targeted gene profiling technologies are gaining popularity for their low costs, high sensitivity and extra (e.g. spatial) information; however, they typically can only measure up to a few hundred genes. Then another challenging question is how to select genes for targeted gene profiling based on existing scRNA-seq data. Results: Here, we develop the single-cell Projective Non-negative Matrix Factorization (scPNMF) method to select informative genes from scRNA-seq data in an unsupervised way. Compared with existing gene selection methods, scPNMF has two advantages. First, its selected informative genes can better distinguish cell types. Second, it enables the alignment of new targeted gene profiling data with reference data in a low-dimensional space to facilitate the prediction of cell types in the new data. Technically, scPNMF modifies the PNMF algorithm for gene selection by changing the initialization and adding a basis selection step, which selects informative bases to distinguish cell types. We demonstrate that scPNMF outperforms the state-of-the-art gene selection methods on diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, we show that scPNMF can guide the design of targeted gene profiling experiments and the cell-type annotation on targeted gene profiling data.

The extent of AT loss ranges from partial, as in familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), to a total absence of metabolically active AT in congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) and is generally associated with the severity of metabolic complications. Significant genetic, allelic, phenotypic, and clinical heterogeneity exists among the lipodystrophies. Patients with FPLD3 due to mutations in the PPARG gene, which encodes a key transcriptional regulator of adipocyte development and function, provide a particularly striking example of this heterogeneity. We will present several gene-gene and gene-environment factors and mechanisms that are critical for adequate PPAR gamma expression and activity in AT and discuss how these interactions potentially contribute to the observed spectrum of FPLD3 phenotypes.

Concepts in Multifactorial Etiology of Developmental Disorders: Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions in Holoprosencephaly	FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Review						birth defect; holoprosencephaly; hedgehog signaling; teratogen; fetal alcohol; genetics; epidemiology	FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME; SIGNALING PATHWAY; RISK-FACTORS; HEDGEHOG; MUTATIONS; SPECTRUM; ETHANOL; SHH; PATHOGENESIS; FOREBRAIN	Many common developmental disorders are thought to arise from a complex set of genetic and environmental risk factors. These factors interact with each other to affect the strength and duration of key developmental signaling pathways, thereby increasing the possibility that they fail to achieve the thresholds required for normal embryonic patterning. One such disorder, holoprosencephaly (HPE), serves as a useful model system in understanding various forms of multifactorial etiology. Genomic analysis of HPE cases, epidemiology, and mechanistic studies of animal models have illuminated multiple potential ways that risk factors interact to produce adverse developmental outcomes. Among these are: 1) interactions between driver and modifier genes; 2) oligogenic inheritance, wherein each parent provides predisposing variants in one or multiple distinct loci; 3) interactions between genetic susceptibilities and environmental risk factors that may be insufficient on their own; and 4) interactions of multiple genetic variants with multiple non-genetic risk factors. These studies combine to provide concepts that illuminate HPE and are also applicable to additional disorders with complex etiology, including neural tube defects, congenital heart defects, and oro-facial clefting.

Orthopoxviruses (ORPV), a genus within the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, infect diverse mammals and include one of the most devastating human pathogens, the now eradicated smallpox virus. ORPV encode similar to 200 genes, of which roughly half are directly involved in virus genome replication and expression as well as virion morphogenesis. The remaining similar to 100 "accessory" genes are responsible for virus-host interactions, particularly counter-defense of innate immunity. Complete sequences are currently available for several hundred ORPV genomes isolated from a variety of mammalian hosts, providing a rich resource for comparative genomics and reconstruction of ORPV evolution. To identify the provenance and evolutionary trends of the ORPV accessory genes, we constructed clusters including the orthologs of these genes from all chordopoxviruses. Most of the accessory genes were captured in three major waves early in chordopoxvirus evolution, prior to the divergence of ORPV and the sister genus Centapoxvirus from their common ancestor. The capture of these genes from the host was followed by extensive gene duplication, yielding several paralogous gene families. In addition, nine genes were gained during the evolution of ORPV themselves. In contrast, nearly every accessory gene was lost, some on multiple, independent occasions in numerous lineages of ORPV, so that no ORPV retains them all. A variety of functional interactions could be inferred from examination of pairs of ORPV accessory genes that were either often or rarely lost concurrently. IMPORTANCE Orthopoxviruses (ORPV) include smallpox (variola) virus, one of the most devastating human pathogens, and vaccinia virus, comprising the vaccine used for smallpox eradication. Among roughly 200 ORPV genes, about half are essential for genome replication and expression as well as virion morphogenesis, whereas the remaining half consists of accessory genes counteracting the host immune response. We reannotated the accessory genes of ORPV, predicting the functions of uncharacterized genes, and reconstructed the history of their gain and loss during the evolution of ORPV. Most of the accessory genes were acquired in three major waves antedating the origin of ORPV from chordopoxviruses. The evolution of ORPV themselves was dominated by gene loss, with numerous genes lost at the base of each major group of ORPV. Examination of pairs of ORPV accessory genes that were either often or rarely lost concurrently during ORPV evolution allows prediction of different types of functional interactions.

Genome-Wide Analysis of Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions Using Closed-Form Wald Tests	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						closed-form; epistasis; genome-wide	MISSING HERITABILITY; ASSOCIATION; EPISTASIS; LOCI; STRATEGIES; MODELS; DETECT; TOOL	Despite the successful discovery of hundreds of variants for complex human traits using genome-wide association studies, the degree to which genes and environmental risk factors jointly affect disease risk is largely unknown. One obstacle toward this goal is that the computational effort required for testing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions is enormous. As a result, numerous computationally efficient tests were recently proposed. However, the validity of these methods often relies on unrealistic assumptions such as additive main effects, main effects at only one variable, no linkage disequilibrium between the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a pair or gene-environment independence. Here, we derive closed-form and consistent estimates for interaction parameters and propose to use Wald tests for testing interactions. The Wald tests are asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), largely considered to be the gold standard tests but generally too computationally demanding for genome-wide interaction analysis. Simulation studies show that the proposed Wald tests have very similar performances with the LRTs but are much more computationally efficient. Applying the proposed tests to a genome-wide study of multiple sclerosis, we identify interactions within the major histocompatibility complex region. In this application, we find that (1) focusing on pairs where both SNPs are marginally significant leads to more significant interactions when compared to focusing on pairs where at least one SNP is marginally significant; and (2) parsimonious parameterization of interaction effects might decrease, rather than increase, statistical power.

Compared with independent effects of genetic and environmental factors, interactions between them help in the understanding of the susceptibility to male infertility. Thus, we genotyped 25 polymorphisms, measured 16 urinary chemical concentrations and explored interactions between gene-gene and gene-environment in 1039 Han Chinese using metabolomic analysis. We first observed that GSTT1 might interact with GSTM1 (P-inter = 6.33 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, an interaction between GSTM1 and 4-n-octylphenol (4-n-OP) was identified (P-inter = 7.00 x 10(-3)), as well as a 2-order interaction among GSTT1, GSTM1 and 4-n-OP (P-inter = 0.04). Subjects with GSTT1-present and GSTM1-null genotypes were susceptible to male infertility when exposed to 4-n-OP (OR = 14.05, 95% CI = 4.78-60.20, P = 2.34 x 10(-5)). Most metabolites identified were involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In conclusion, it is a novel study of the interaction on male infertility from the aspect of metabolomics.

Eotaxins are cytokines that promote pulmonary eosinophilia via the receptor CCR3. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCR3 and eotaxin genes are associated with asthma. In this study, genetic interactions among SNPs of several eotaxin genes and CCR3 were assessed and their relationship with blood eosinophilia in asthma was examined. Methods: A total of 533 asthmatics were enrolled in this study. Asthmatics with eosinophilia (>0.5 x 10(9)/L) were compared with those without eosinophilia (<= 0.5 x 10(9)/L Chi-square tests were used to compare SNP frequencies. Two different models were used to evaluate gene-gene interactions: logistic regression and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). Results: EOT2+304C> A (29L> I) was significantly associated with 3 of the 4 CCM SNPs among asthmatics with eosinophilia (P=0.037-0.009). EOT2+304C> A (29L> I) and the CCR3 SNPs were also significantly associated with blood eosinophilia in an interaction model constructed by logistic regression (P=0.0087). GMDR analysis showed that the combination of EOT2+304C> A (29L> I) and CCR3-174C> T was the best model (accuracy= 0.536, P=0.005, CVC 9/10). Conclusions: The epistatic influence of CCR3 on eotaxin gene variants indicates that these variants may be candidate markers for eosinophilia in asthma.

Network-based methods such as statistical epistasis networks (SEN), present an intuitive framework to address the computational challenge of studying pairwise interactions between thousands of genetic variants. In this study, we aimed to analyze pairwise interactions that are associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) between SNPs from twelve genes robustly associated with obesity (BDNF, ETV5, FAIM2, FTO, GNPDA2, KCTD15, MC4R, MTCH2, NEGR1, SEC16B, SH2B1, and TMEM18). Methods: We used information gain measures to identify all SNP-SNP interactions among and between these genes that were related to obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) within the Framingham Heart Study Cohort; interactions exceeding a certain threshold were used to build an SEN. We also quantified whether interactions tend to occur more between SNPs from the same gene (dyadicity) or between SNPs from different genes (heterophilicity). Results: We identified a highly connected SEN of 709 SNPs and 1241 SNP-SNP interactions. Combining the SEN framework with dyadicity and heterophilicity analyses, we found 1 dyadic gene (TMEM18, P-value = 0.047) and 3 heterophilic genes (KCTD15, P-value = 0.045; SH2B1, P-value = 0.003; and TMEM18, P-value = 0.001). We also identified a lncRNA SNP (rs4358154) as a key node within the SEN using multiple network measures. Conclusion: This study presents an analytical framework to characterize the global landscape of genetic interactions from genome-wide arrays and also to discover nodes of potential biological significance within the identified network.

Hodgkin Disease Risk: Role of Genetic Polymorphisms and Gene-Gene Interactions in Inflammation Pathway Genes	MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS			English	Article						Hodgkin disease; inflammation genes; cytokine polymorphisms	B-CELL LYMPHOMA; REGULATORY T-CELLS; BREAST-CANCER; EXPRESSION; INTERLEUKIN-10; CYTOKINES; LYMPHOCYTES; RECEPTORS; CARCINOMA; SURVIVAL	Inflammation is a critical component of cancer development. The clinical and pathological features of Hodgkin disease (HD) reflect an abnormal immunity that results from cytokines secreted by Reed-Sternberg cells and the surrounding tumor. Numerous studies have reported the association between genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes and the susceptibility to different hematologic cancers. However, the effects of such SNPs on modulating HD risk have not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that gene-gene interactions between candidate genes in the anti-and pro-inflammatory pathways carrying suspicious polymorphisms may contribute to susceptibility to HD. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a study on 200 HD cases and 220 controls to assess associations between HD risk and 38 functional SNPs in inflammatory genes. We evaluated potential gene-gene interactions using a multi-analytic strategy combining logistic regression, multi-factor dimensionality reduction, and classification and regression tree (CART) approaches. We observed that, in combination, allelic variants in the COX2, IL18, ILR4, and IL10 genes modify the risk for developing HD. Moreover, the cumulative genetic risk score (CGRS) revealed a significant trend where the risk for developing HD increases as the number of adverse alleles in the cytokine genes increase. These findings support the notion that epigenetic-interactions between these cytokines may influence pathogenesis of HD modulating the proliferation of regulatory T cells. In this way, the innate and adaptative immune responses may be altered and defy their usual functions in the host anti-tumor response. Our study is the first to report the association between polymorphisms in inflammation genes and HD susceptibility risk. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Both the etiology of KD and the erythema of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) injection sites observed in the disease are poorly understood. We investigated the association between KD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two candidate genes: inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3-kinase (ITPKC), a well-studied KD-associated gene, and solute carrier 11a1 (SLC11A1), which is associated with the hypersensitive reaction to the BCG strain in Koreans. Materials and Methods: Associations between KD and SNPs in two genes were evaluated. Potential associations between BCG injection site erythema and SNPs in two genes were also evaluated. Gene-gene interactions between ITPKC and SLC11A1 in KD and BCG injection site erythema were also analyzed. Results: Three tagging SNPs in ITPKC and five tagging SNPs in SLC11A1 were genotyped in 299 KD patients and 210 control children. SNP rs28493229 in ITPKC was associated with KD and coronary artery complications. SNP rs77624405 in SLC11A1 was associated with KD. Comparisons of KD patients with and without BCG injection site erythema revealed that SNP rs17235409 in SLC11A1 was associated with erythema; no erythema-associated SNPs in ITPKC were identified. Interactions between ITPKC rs28493229_GG and SLC11A1 rs17235409_GA and between ITPKC rs10420685_GG and SLC11A1 rs17235409_AA were strongly associated with BCG injection site erythema. Conclusion: This study identified several important polymorphisms in the ITPKC and SLC11A1 genes in Koreans. The genetic variants identified in this study affected KD and erythema of BCG injection sites independently and through gene-gene interactions. Also, the effects of the polymorphisms were age-dependent.

Complex diseases, such as cancer, hypertension, diabetes, are thought to be caused by an interaction of a panel of genetic factors, that can be identified by markers, which modulate environmental factors. Moreover, the effect of each genetic marker may be small. Hence, the association signal may be missed unless a large sample is considered, or a priori biomedical data are used. Recent advances generated a vast variety of a priori information, including linkage maps and information about gene regulatory dependence assembled into curated pathway databases. We propose a genotype-based approach that takes into account linkage disequilibrium (LD) information between genetic markers that are in moderate LD while modeling gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. A major advantage of our method is that the observed genetic information enters a model directly thus eliminating the need to estimate haplotype-phase. Our approach results in an algorithm that is inexpensive computationally and does not suffer from bias induced by haplotype-phase ambiguity. We investigated our model in a series of simulation experiments and demonstrated that the proposed approach results in estimates that are nearly unbiased and have small variability. We applied our method to the analysis of data from a melanoma case-control study and investigated interaction between a set of pigmentation genes and environmental factors defined by age and gender. Furthermore, an application of our method is demonstrated using a study of Alcohol Dependence.

Gene variants may affect disease outcome by acting synergistically or antagonistically and thus their combined effect becomes an important aspect to study in the disease etiology. In the present investigation, interaction between ten functional polymorphisms in DRD4, DAT1, MAOA, COMT, and DBH genes were explored in the Indo-Caucasoid population. ADHD cases were recruited based on DSM-IV criteria. Peripheral blood samples were collected from ADHD probands (N = 126), their parents (N = 233) and controls (N = 96) after obtaining informed written consent for participation. Genomic DNA was subjected to PCR based analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs). Data obtained was examined for population as well as family-based association analyses. While case-control analysis revealed higher occurrence of DAT1 intron 8 VNTR 5R allele (P = 0.02) in cases, significant preferential transmission of the 7R-T (DRD4 exon3 VNTR-rs1800955) and 3R-T (MAOA-u VNTR-rs6323) haplotypes were noticed from parents to probands (P=0.02 and 0.002 respectively). Gene-gene interaction analysis revealed significant additive effect of DBH rs1108580 and DRD4 rs1800955 with significant main effects of DRD4 exon3 VNTR. DAT1 3'UTR and intron 8 VNTR, MAOA u-VNTR, rs6323, COMT rs4680, rs362204, DBH rs1611115 and rs1108580 thereby pointing towards a strong association of these markers with ADHD. Correlation between gene variants, high ADHD score and low DBH enzymatic activity was also noticed, especially in male probands. From these observations, an impact of the studied sites on the disease etiology could be speculated in this ethnic group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We constructed a time-based gene regulatory network of zebrafish cardiogenesis on the basis of a spatio-temporal neighborhood method. Through the network, specific regulatory pathways and order of gene expression during zebrafish cardiogenesis were obtained. By comparing the order with locations of these genes on chromosomes, we discovered that there exists a reversal phenomenon between the order and order of gene locations. The discovery provides an inherent rule to instruct exploration of gene regulatory relationships. Specifically, the discovery can help to predict if regulatory relationships between genes exist and contribute to evaluating the correctness of discovered gene regulatory relationships.

Investigating the evolution of the expression patterns of genes that duplicated after the divergence of rodents and primates, we confirm that adaptive evolution has been involved in dosage rebalance after gene duplication. To understand mechanisms underlying this process, we examined 1) microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation, 2) cis-regulatory sequence modifications, and 3) DNA methylation. Neither miRNA-mediated regulation nor cis-regulatory changes was found to be associated with expression reduction of duplicate genes. By contrast, duplicate genes, especially lowly expressed copies, were heavily methylated in the upstream region. However, for duplicate genes encoding proteins that are members of macromolecular complexes, heavy methylation in the genic region was not consistently observed. This result held after controlling potential confounding factors, such as enrichment in functional categories. Our results suggest that during mammalian evolution, DNA methylation plays a dominant role in dosage rebalance after gene duplication by inhibiting transcription initiation of duplicate genes.

As the number of interaction terms grows fast, sparse estimation is desirable from statistical and interpretability reasons. There is a large literature on sparse estimation, but there is a natural hierarchy between the interaction and its corresponding main effects that requires special considerations. We describe random-effect models that impose sparse estimation of interactions under both strong and weak-hierarchy constraints. We develop an estimation procedure based on the hierarchical-likelihood argument and show that the modelling approach is equivalent to a penalty-based method, with the advantage of the models being more transparent and flexible. We compare the procedure with some standard methods in a simulation study and illustrate its application in an analysis of gene-gene interaction model to predict body-mass index.

EpiChIP: gene-by-gene quantification of epigenetic modification levels	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							PROTEIN-DNA INTERACTIONS; HUMAN GENOME; CHIP-SEQ; HISTONE MODIFICATIONS; REGULATORY ELEMENT; METHYLATIONS; EXPRESSION; ENHANCERS	The combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing technology (ChIP-seq) is a powerful and increasingly popular method for mapping protein-DNA interactions in a genome-wide fashion. The conventional way of analyzing this data is to identify sequencing peaks along the chromosomes that are significantly higher than the read background. For histone modifications and other epigenetic marks, it is often preferable to find a characteristic region of enrichment in sequencing reads relative to gene annotations. For instance, many histone modifications are typically enriched around transcription start sites. Calculating the optimal window that describes this enrichment allows one to quantify modification levels for each individual gene. Using data sets for the H3K9/14ac histone modification in Th cells and an accompanying IgG control, we present an analysis strategy that alternates between single gene and global data distribution levels and allows a clear distinction between experimental background and signal. Curve fitting permits false discovery rate-based classification of genes as modified versus unmodified. We have developed a software package called EpiChIP that carries out this type of analysis, including integration with and visualization of gene expression data.

Such studies have provided numerous insights into the biology of hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution and contributed to clinical development of gene and cell therapies. Tracking of hematopoietic reconstitution and analysis of the origin of residual malignant disease after hematopoietic transplantation has been possible via gene marking. Introduction of selectable marker genes has enabled preselection of specific T-cell populations for tumor and viral immunotherapy and reduced the threat of graft-versus-host disease, improving the survival of patients after allogeneic marrow transplantation. Marking studies in humans, murine xenografts, and large animals have helped optimize conditions for gene transfer into CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors, contributing to the achievement of gene transfer efficiencies sufficient for clinical benefit in several serious genetic diseases such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency and adrenoleukodystropy. When adverse events linked to insertional mutagenesis arose in clinical gene therapy trials for inherited immunodeficiencies, additional animal studies using gene-marking vectors have greatly increased our understanding of genotoxicity. The knowledge gained from these studies is being translated into new vector designs and clinical protocols, which we hope will continue to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and safety of these promising therapeutic approaches.

Virtually all studies have reported associations between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits. However, it is likely that complex traits are influenced by interaction of multiple SNPs. One approach to detect interactions of SNPs is the brute force approach which performs a pairwise association test between a trait and each pair of SNPs. The brute force approach is often computationally infeasible because of the large number of SNPs collected in current GWAS studies. We propose a two-stage model, Threshold-based Efficient Pairwise Association Approach (TEPAA), to reduce the number of tests needed while maintaining almost identical power to the brute force approach. In the first stage, our method performs the single marker test on all SNPs and selects a subset of SNPs that achieve a certain significance threshold. In the second stage, we perform a pairwise association test between traits and pairs of the SNPs selected from the first stage. The key insight of our approach is that we derive the joint distribution between the association statistics of a single SNP and the association statistics of pairs of SNPs. This joint distribution allows us to provide guarantees that the statistical power of our approach will closely approximate the brute force approach. We applied our approach to the Northern Finland Birth Cohort data and achieved 63 times speedup while maintaining 99% of the power of the brute force approach.

However, predicting the different types of tumors is a challenging task since the sample size in microarray data is often small but the dimensionality is very high. Gene selection, which is an effective means, is aimed at mitigating the curse of dimensionality problem and can boost the classification accuracy of microarray data. However, many of previous gene selection methods focus on model design, but neglect the correlation between different genes. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised gene selection method by taking the gene correlation into consideration, named gene correlation guided gene selection (G(3)CS). Specifically, we calculate the covariance of different gene dimension pairs and embed it into our unsupervised gene selection model to regularize the gene selection coefficient matrix. In such a manner, redundant genes can be effectively excluded. In addition, we utilize a matrix factorization term to exploit the cluster structure of original microarray data to assist the learning process. We design an iterative updating algorithm with convergence guarantee to solve the resultant optimization problem. Experimental results on six publicly available microarray datasets are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed method.

Recent genome-wide studies reported about 600 genes potentially influencing neuroticism. Little is known about the mechanisms of their action. Here, we aimed to conduct a more detailed analysis of genes that can regulate the level of neuroticism. Using UK Biobank-based GWAS summary statistics, we performed a gene-based association analysis using four sets of within-gene variants, each set possessing specific protein-coding properties. To guard against the influence of strong GWAS signals outside the gene, we used a specially designed procedure called "polygene pruning". As a result, we identified 190 genes associated with neuroticism due to the effect of within-gene variants rather than strong GWAS signals outside the gene. Thirty eight of these genes are new. Within all genes identified, we distinguished two slightly overlapping groups obtained from using protein-coding and non-coding variants. Many genes in the former group included potentially pathogenic variants. For some genes in the latter group, we found evidence of pleiotropy with gene expression. Using a bioinformatics analysis, we prioritized the neuroticism genes and showed that the genes that contribute to neuroticism through their within-gene variants are the most appropriate candidate genes.

However, statistical consistency of summary coalescence methods is not guaranteed unless several model assumptions are true, including the critical assumption that recombination occurs freely among but not within coalescence genes (c-genes), which are the fundamental units of analysis for these methods. Each c-gene has a single branching history, and large sets of these independent gene histories should be the input for genome-scale coalescence estimates of phylogeny. By contrast, numerous studies have reported the results of coalescence analyses in which complete protein-coding sequences are treated as c-genes even though exons for these loci can span more than a megabase of DNA. Empirical estimates of recombination breakpoints suggest that c-genes may be much shorter, especially when large clades with many species are the focus of analysis. Although this idea has been challenged recently in the literature, the inverse relationship between c-gene size and increased taxon sampling in a dataset-the 'recombination ratchet'-is a fundamental property of c-genes. For taxonomic groups characterized by genes with long intron sequences, complete protein-coding sequences are likely not valid c-genes and are inappropriate units of analysis for summary coalescence methods unless they occur in recombination deserts that are devoid of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Finally, it has been argued that coalescence methods are robust when the no-recombination within loci assumption is violated, but recombination must matter at some scale because ILS, a by-product of recombination, is the raison d'etre for coalescence methods. That is, extensive recombination is required to yield the large number of independently segregating c-genes used to infer a species tree. If coalescent methods are powerful enough to infer the correct species tree for difficult phylogenetic problems in the anomaly zone, where concatenation is expected to fail because of ILS, then there should be a decreasing probability of inferring the correct species tree using longer loci with many intralocus recombination breakpoints (i.e., increased levels of concatenation).

However, it remains unknown whether translational selection associates closely with gene age and acts differentially on genes with different evolutionary ages. To address this issue, here we investigate the strength of translational selection acting on different aged genes in human. Our results show that old genes present stronger translational selection than young genes, demonstrating that translational selection correlates positively with gene age. We further explore the difference of translational selection in duplicates vs. singletons and in housekeeping vs. tissue-specific genes. We find that translational selection acts comparably in old singletons and old duplicates and stronger translational selection in old genes is contributed primarily by housekeeping genes. For young genes, contrastingly, singletons experience stronger translational selection than duplicates, presumably due to redundant function of duplicated genes during their early evolutionary stage. Taken together, our results indicate that translational selection acting on a gene would not be constant during all stages of evolution, associating closely with gene age. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Inferring Nonstationary Gene Networks from Longitudinal Gene Expression Microarrays	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Nonstationary networks; Bayesian networks; Distributed computation; Gene expression	REGULATORY NETWORKS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS	Inferring gene networks from longitudinal gene expression microarrays is a crucial step towards the study of gene regulatory mechanisms. A decade ago, expensive microarray technology restricted the number of samples undergoing gene expression profiling in single studies, leading the inference algorithms that assume stationary gene networks to the best solution. Thanks to decreasing cost of modern microarray technologies, more gene expression profiles can be assessed in single studies. With more samples available, we can relax the stationarity assumption and develop a method to infer dynamic gene networks, which can reflect more realistic biology where genes adaptively orchestrate each other. This paper applied the framework of dynamic Bayesian networks to infer adaptive gene interactions by identifying individual transition networks between pairs of consecutive times. Due to high computational burden of inferring the interconnection patterns among all genes over time, we designed a parallelizable inference algorithm to make feasible the task. We validated our approach by two clinical studies: yellow fever vaccination and mechanical periodontal therapy. The inferred dynamic networks achieved more than 90% predictive accuracy, a significant improvement when compared to stationary models (p<0.05). The adaptive models can help explain the induction of innate immunology in greater details after yellow fever vaccination and interpret the anti-inflammatory effect of mechanical periodontal therapy.

We have recently identified human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) as a principle component in the multifactorial causation of SG-MEC. This finding is corroborated by the ability of the purified mouse CMV (mCMV) to induce malignant transformation of SG cells in a three-dimensional in vitro mouse model, using a similar oncogenic signaling pathway. Our prior studies indicate that the core tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key regulator of pathologic progression, particularly the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) component. Studies of early CAFs immunodetect aberrant expression of ECM components, as well as multiple growth factors, cytokines and transcription factors. Here we present the mechanistic insight derived from a mathematical structure ("wiring diagram") used to model complex relationships between a highly relevant (p = 9.43 x 10(-12)) global "cancer network" of 32 genes and their known links. Detailed characterization of the functional architecture of the examined "cancer network" exposes the critical crosstalk and compensatory pathways that limit the efficacy of targeted anti-kinase therapies.

This enzyme plays an important role in repair of DNA damage and in maintaining genomic stability. ERCC1-XPF nuclease nicks DNA specifically at junctions between double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, when the single-strand is oriented 5' to 3' away from a junction. ERCC1-XPF is a core component of nucleotide excision repair and also plays a role in interstrand crosslink repair, some pathways of double-strand break repair by homologous recombination and end-joining, as a backup enzyme in base excision repair, and in telomere length regulation. In many of these activities, ERCC1 XPF complex cleaves the 3' tails of DNA intermediates in preparation for further processing. ERCC1 XPF interacts with other proteins including XPA, RPA, SLX4 and TRF2 to perform its functions. Disruption of these interactions or direct targeting of ERCC1 XPF to decrease its DNA repair function might be a useful strategy to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to some DNA damaging agents. Complete deletion of either ERCC1 or ERCC4 is not compatible with viability in mice or humans. However, mutations in the ERCC1 or ERCC4 genes cause a remarkable array of rare inherited human disorders. These include specific forms of xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, Fanconi anemia, XFE progeria and cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We describe a pathosystem between A. thaliana and biovar 3 phylotype I strain BCCF402 of R. solanacearum isolated from Eucalyptus trees. A. thaliana accession Be-0 was susceptible and accession Kil-0 was tolerant. Kil-0 exhibited no wilting symptoms and no significant reduction in fitness (biomass, seed yield, and germination efficiency) after inoculation with R. solanacearum BCCF402, despite high bacterial numbers in planta. This was in contrast to the well-characterized resistance response in the accession Nd-1, which limits bacterial multiplication at early stages of infection and does not wilt. R. solanacearum BCCF402 was highly virulent because the susceptible accession Be-0 was completely wilted after inoculation. Genetic analyses, allelism studies with Nd-1, and RRS1 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker analysis showed that the tolerance phenotype in Kil-0 was dependent upon the resistance gene RRS1. Knockout and complementation studies of the R. solanacearum BCCF402 effector PopP2 confirmed that the tolerance response in Kil-0 was dependent upon the RRS1-PopP2 interaction. Our data indicate that the gene-for-gene interaction between RRS1 and PopP2 can contribute to tolerance, as well as resistance, which makes it a useful model system for evolutionary studies of the arms race between plants and bacterial pathogens. In addition, the results alert biotechnologists to the risk that deployment of RRS1 in transgenic crops may result in persistence of the pathogen in the field.

To this end, many statistical methods have been proposed in the literature. However, powerful yet robust approaches are yet to be developed. In this paper we study the gene-gene interaction tests for case-control GWASs. A number of powerful tests can be constructed for given situations. We also discuss some tests for the main effects and the overall tests for association between genotype and phenotype. A simulation study is conducted to compare some of the proposed tests with existing methods. A real data application is also conducted to illustrate the use of the proposed tests.

Candidate genes for panhypopituitarism identified by gene expression profiling. Physiol Genomics 43: 1105-1116, 2011. First published August 9, 2011; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00080.2011.-Mutations in the transcription factors PROP1 and PIT1 (POU1F1) lead to pituitary hormone deficiency and hypopituitarism in mice and humans. The dysmorphology of developing Prop1 mutant pituitaries readily distinguishes them from those of Pit1 mutants and normal mice. This and other features suggest that Prop1 controls the expression of genes besides Pit1 that are important for pituitary cell migration, survival, and differentiation. To identify genes involved in these processes we used microarray analysis of gene expression to compare pituitary RNA from newborn Prop1 and Pit1 mutants and wild-type littermates. Significant differences in gene expression were noted between each mutant and their normal littermates, as well as between Prop1 and Pit1 mutants. Otx2, a gene critical for normal eye and pituitary development in humans and mice, exhibited elevated expression specifically in Prop1 mutant pituitaries. We report the spatial and temporal regulation of Otx2 in normal mice and Prop1 mutants, and the results suggest Otx2 could influence pituitary development by affecting signaling from the ventral diencephalon and regulation of gene expression in Rathke's pouch. The discovery that Otx2 expression is affected by Prop1 deficiency provides support for our hypothesis that identifying molecular differences in mutants will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms that control pituitary organogenesis and lead to human pituitary disease.

Recent advances in technologies have enhanced the toolkit for testing GRN mechanisms and connections. Here we emphasize three approaches that we have found important for interrogating transcriptional mechanisms in echinoderms: single cell mRNA sequencing (drop-seq), nascent RNAdetection and identification, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We present these applications in order since it is a logical experimental protocol. With preliminary information from bulk mRNA transcriptome analysis and differential gene expression studies (DE-seq), one may need to test in what specific cells important genes may be expressed and to use single cell sequencing to define such links. Nascent RNA analysis with the Click-iT chemistry allows the investigator to deduce when the RNA was transcribed, not just identify its presence, and ChIP allows the investigator to study direct interactions of putative transcriptional regulators with the gene promoter of interest. This flow of thinking, and the technologies to support it, is presented here for echinoderms. While many of the procedures are general and applicable to many organisms and cell types, we emphasize unique aspects of the protocols for consideration in using echinoderm embryos, larvae, and adult tissues.

Candidate Gene Identification of Flowering Time Genes in Cotton	PLANT GENOME			English	Article							LOCUS-T HOMOLOG; 1ST FRUITING BRANCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; KEY REGULATOR; UPLAND COTTON; EVOLUTION; ORTHOLOG; PROTEIN; FAMILY; PLANT	Flowering time control is critically important to all sexually reproducing angiosperms in both natural ecological and agronomic settings. Accordingly, there is much interest in defining the genes involved in the complex flowering-time network and how these respond to natural and artificial selection, the latter often entailing transitions in day-length responses. Here we describe a candidate gene analysis in the cotton genus Gossypium, which uses homologs from the well-described Arabidopsis flowering network to bioinformatically and phylogenetically identify orthologs in the published genome sequence from G. raimondii Ulbr., one of the two model diploid progenitors of the commercially important allopolyploid cottons, G. hirsutum L. and G. barbadense L. Presence and patterns of expression were evaluated from 13 aboveground tissues related to flowering for each of the candidate genes using allopolyploid G. hirsutum as a model. Furthermore, we use a comparative context to determine copy number variability of each key gene family across 10 published angiosperm genomes. Data suggest a pattern of repeated loss of duplicates following ancient whole-genome doubling events in diverse lineages. The data presented here provide a foundation for understanding both the parallel evolution of day-length neutrality in domesticated cottons and the flowering-time network, in general, in this important crop plant.

Exploring the osteoarthritis-related genes by gene expression analysis	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Osteoarthritis; Differentially expressed genes; Microarray; PPI network	RECOMMENDATIONS; ARTHRITIS; INSULIN; BIOLOGY; VEGF	OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) common chronic degenerative joint lesion, which affects both cartilage and bone. A better understanding of the gene expression profiling of OA may help understanding the pathogenesis of OA and finding the therapy targets for OA treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GSE8077 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) including 5 OA rats induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection and partial medial meniscectomy and 5 rats that were performed sham surgery as control. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OA group and control group were identified by t-test with p < 0.05 and the coding genes that transcription factors corresponded were screened by TRANS-FAC. Then Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs and transcription factors were performed. The DEGs and transcription factors were integrated with information from STRING database to construct PPI network. RESULTS: A total of 119 up-regulated genes, 39 down-regulated genes and 9 transcription factors were identified in OA sample. The GO enrichment analysis showed that 119 up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in blood vessel development and KEGG pathway enrichment showed that genes were involved in circadian rhythm pathway. In the PPI network, Cd44, Mmp13, Timp1 and Igf1 showed higher degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The screened genes could provide a new and comprehensive view for treatment of OA.

Combining gene prediction methods to improve metagenomic gene annotation	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DNA; EUKARYOTES; DROSOPHILA; SEQUENCES; GENOMES; REGIONS	Background: Traditional gene annotation methods rely on characteristics that may not be available in short reads generated from next generation technology, resulting in suboptimal performance for metagenomic (environmental) samples. Therefore, in recent years, new programs have been developed that optimize performance on short reads. In this work, we benchmark three metagenomic gene prediction programs and combine their predictions to improve metagenomic read gene annotation. Results: We not only analyze the programs' performance at different read-lengths like similar studies, but also separate different types of reads, including intra- and intergenic regions, for analysis. The main deficiencies are in the algorithms' ability to predict non-coding regions and gene edges, resulting in more false-positives and false negatives than desired. In fact, the specificities of the algorithms are notably worse than the sensitivities. By combining the programs' predictions, we show significant improvement in specificity at minimal cost to sensitivity, resulting in 4% improvement in accuracy for 100 bp reads with similar to 1% improvement in accuracy for 200 bp reads and above. To correctly annotate the start and stop of the genes, we find that a consensus of all the predictors performs best for shorter read lengths while a unanimous agreement is better for longer read lengths, boosting annotation accuracy by 1-8%. We also demonstrate use of the classifier combinations on a real dataset. Conclusions: To optimize the performance for both prediction and annotation accuracies, we conclude that the consensus of all methods (or a majority vote) is the best for reads 400 bp and shorter, while using the intersection of GeneMark and Orphelia predictions is the best for reads 500 bp and longer. We demonstrate that most methods predict over 80% coding (including partially coding) reads on a real human gut sample sequenced by Illumina technology.

Its remarkable success in safety and efficacy, in clinical trials for Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) type II generated significant interest and opened up possibilities for a new era of retinal gene therapies. Success in these clinical trials was mainly due to the favorable characteristics of the retina as a target organ. The eye offers several advantages as it is readily accessible and has some degree of immune privilege making it suitable for application of viral vectors. The viral vectors most frequently used for retinal gene delivery are lentivirus, adenovirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV). Here we will discuss the use of these viral vectors in retinal gene delivery with a strong focus on favorable properties of AAV. Thanks to its small size, AAV diffuses well in the inter-neural matrix making it suitable for applications in neural retina. Building on this initial clinical success with LCA II, we have now many opportunities to extend this proof-of-concept to other retinal diseases using AAV as a vector. This article will discuss what are some of the most imminent cellular targets for such therapies and the AAV toolkit that has been built to target these cells successfully. We will also discuss some of the challenges that we face in translating AAV-based gene therapies to the clinic.

Despite of moderate heritability estimates, progress in identifying the genetic factors underlying aggressive behaviour has been limited. There are currently three genetic mouse models of high and low aggression created using selective breeding. This is the first study to offer a global transcriptomic characterization of the prefrontal cortex across all three genetic mouse models of aggression. A systems biology approach has been applied to transcriptomic data across the three pairs of selected inbred mouse strains (Turku Aggressive (TA) and Turku Non-Aggressive (TNA), Short Attack Latency (SAL) and Long Attack Latency (LAL) mice and North Carolina Aggressive (NC900) and North Carolina Non-Aggressive (NC100)), providing novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms and genetics underlying aggression. First, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify modules of highly correlated genes associated with aggression. Probe sets belonging to gene modules uncovered by WGCNA were carried forward for network analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). The RankProd non-parametric algorithm was then used to statistically evaluate expression differences across the genes belonging to modules significantly associated with aggression. IPA uncovered two pathways, involving NF-kB and MAPKs. The secondary RankProd analysis yielded 14 differentially expressed genes, some of which have previously been implicated in pathways associated with aggressive behaviour, such as Adrbk2. The results highlighted plausible candidate genes and gene networks implicated in aggression-related behaviour.

The genes are weighted according to its degree within a genome-scale functional network constructed using the functional annotations available from the gene ontology database. By benchmarking GOGANPA using a well-studied P53 data set and three breast cancer data sets, we will demonstrate the power and reproducibility of our proposed method over traditional unweighted approaches and a competing network-based approach that involves a complex integrated network. GOGANPA's sole reliance on gene ontology further allows GOGANPA to be widely applicable to the analysis of any gene-ontology-annotated genome.

These interactions could influence homocysteine (Hcy) and diseases contingent thereon. We determined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes, their relationships and interactions with total Hcy concentrations within black South Africans to address the increased prevalence of diseases associated with Hcy. The MTHFR 677 TT and MTR 2756 AA genotypes were associated with higher Hcy concentrations (16.6 and 10.1 mu mol/L; p < 0.05) compared to subjects harboring the MTHFR 677 CT/CC and the MTR 2756 AG genotypes (10.5, 9.7 and 9.5 mu mol/L, respectively). The investigated CBS genotypes did not influence Hcy. We demonstrated interactions between the area of residence and the CBS T833C/844ins68 genotypes (p = 0.005) so that when harboring the wildtype allele, rural subjects had significantly higher Hcy than their urban counterparts, but when hosting the variant allele the environment made no difference to Hcy. Between the CBS T833C/844ins68 or G9276A and MTHFR C677T genotypes, there were two-way interactions (p = 0.003 and = 0.004, respectively), with regard to Hcy. Subjects harboring the MTHFR 677 TT genotype in combination with the CBS 833 TT/homozygous 844 non-insert or the MTHFR 677 IF genotype in combination with the CBS 9276 GA/GG displayed higher Hcy concentrations. Therefore, some of the investigated genotypes affected Hcy; residential area changed the way in which the CBS T833C/844ins68 SNPs influenced Hcy concentrations highlighting the importance of environmental factors; and gene-gene interactions allude to epistalic effects.

In this study, we investigated the association between alpha CGRP gene polymorphism (CALCA T-692C) and migraine. Material and Methods: One hundred and thirty-four female migraineurs and 96 healthy female cases were enrolled in the study. The patient group was further subdivided into migraine with and without aura groups. The CALCA T-692C gene polymorphism was identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Results: The genotype and allele frequencies of CALCA T-692C gene polymorphism did not differ between the migraine and control groups. Between the migraine with and without aura subgroups, there was no difference. No association was seen between the CALCA T-692C gene polymorphisms and migraine attack severity and frequency. Conclusion: Our study did not show any association between CALCA T-692C gene polymorphism and migraine.

However, the main application of MDR has been limited to binary traits, while traits having ordinal features are commonly observed in many genetic studies (e. g., obesity classification - normal, pre-obese, mild obese and severe obese). Methods: We propose ordinal MDR (OMDR) to facilitate gene-gene interaction analysis for ordinal traits. As an alternative to balanced accuracy, the use of tau-b, a common ordinal association measure, was suggested to evaluate interactions. Also, we generalized cross-validation consistency (GCVC) to identify multiple best interactions. GCVC can be practically useful for analyzing complex traits, especially in large-scale genetic studies. Results and conclusions: In simulations, OMDR showed fairly good performance in terms of power, predictability and selection stability and outperformed MDR. For demonstration, we used a real data of body mass index (BMI) and scanned 1 similar to 4-way interactions of obesity ordinal and binary traits of BMI via OMDR and MDR, respectively. In real data analysis, more interactions were identified for ordinal trait than binary traits. On average, the commonly identified interactions showed higher predictability for ordinal trait than binary traits. The proposed OMDR and GCVC were implemented in a C/C++ program, executables of which are freely available for Linux, Windows and MacOS upon request for non-commercial research institutions.

Antivirulence Genes: Insights into Pathogen Evolution through Gene Loss	INFECTION AND IMMUNITY			English	Review							ENTEROINVASIVE-ESCHERICHIA-COLI; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; YERSINIA-PESTIS; SALMONELLA-ENTERICA; SHIGELLA-FLEXNERI; FRANCISELLA-TULARENSIS; CONVERGENT EVOLUTION; BACTERIAL PATHOGENS; III SECRETION; BLACK-HOLES	The emergence of new pathogens and the exploitation of novel pathogenic niches by bacteria typically require the horizontal transfer of virulence factors and subsequent adaptation-a "fine-tuning" process-for the successful incorporation of these factors into the microbe's genome. The function of newly acquired virulence factors may be hindered by the expression of genes already present in the bacterium. Occasionally, certain genes must be inactivated or deleted for full expression of the pathogen phenotype to occur. These genes are known as antivirulence genes (AVGs). Originally identified in Shigella, AVGs have improved our understanding of pathogen evolution and provided a novel approach to drug and vaccine development. In this review, we revisit the AVG definition and update the list of known AVGs, which now includes genes from pathogens such as Salmonella, Yersinia pestis, and the virulent Francisella tularensis subspecies. AVGs encompass a wide variety of different roles within the microbe, including genes involved in metabolism, biofilm synthesis, lipopolysaccharide modification, and host vasoconstriction. More recently, the use of one of these AVGs (lpxL) as a potential vaccine candidate highlights the practical application of studying AVG inactivation in microbial pathogens.

Herein we report that multimerized siRNA conjugate composed of two different siRNA sequences in the same backbone shows more efficient inhibition of the two corresponding target genes at one time than physically mixed multimerized siRNA conjugates. Two model siRNAs against VEGF and GFP gene were chemically crosslinked via cleavable and noncleavable linkages for the preparation of dual gene targeted multimeric siRNA conjugates (DGT multi-siRNA). Cleavable DGT multi-siRNA with reducible disulfide linkages exhibited significantly higher gene silencing efficiencies at mRNA and protein expression levels than noncleavable DGT multi-siRNA, the physical mixture of naked siRNA, and that of single gene targeted multimeric siRNA (SGT multi-siRNA) with eliciting negligible immune response. DGT multi-siRNAs against two therapeutic siRNAs, anti-survivin and anti-bcl-2 targeted siRNA, also showed greatly enhanced apoptotic effect. This approach for concurrent suppression of combinatorial therapeutic target genes using cleavable multimeric siRNA structure can be potentially used for improved therapeutic efficacy.

Transcription factors (ifs) constitute the 'classic' tool for synthetic circuit construction but some of their inherent constraints, such as insufficient modularity, orthogonality and programmability, limit progress in such forward-engineering endeavors. Here we review how CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology offers new and powerful possibilities for synthetic circuit design. CRISPR systems offer superior characteristics over TFs in many aspects relevant to a modular, predictable and standardized circuit design. Thus, the choice of CRISPR technology as a framework for synthetic circuit design constitutes a valid alternative to complement or replace TFs in synthetic circuits and promises the realization of more ambitious designs.

J	Wei, CS; Lu, Q				Wei, Changshuai; Lu, Qing			GWGGI: software for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis	BMC GENETICS			English	Article						Mann-whitney; Non-parametric statistic; Tree model	MANN-WHITNEY APPROACH; ASSOCIATION	Background: While the importance of gene-gene interactions in human diseases has been well recognized, identifying them has been a great challenge, especially through association studies with millions of genetic markers and thousands of individuals. Computationally efficient and powerful tools are in great need for the identification of new gene-gene interactions in high-dimensional association studies. Result: We develop C++ software for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analyses (GWGGI). GWGGI utilizes tree-based algorithms to search a large number of genetic markers for a disease-associated joint association with the consideration of high-order interactions, and then uses non-parametric statistics to test the joint association. The package includes two functions, likelihood ratio Mann-Whitney (LRMW) and Tree Assembling Mann-Whitney (TAMW). We optimize the data storage and computational efficiency of the software, making it feasible to run the genome-wide analysis on a personal computer. The use of GWGGI was demonstrated by using two real data-sets with nearly 500 k genetic markers. Conclusion: Through the empirical study, we demonstrated that the genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis using GWGGI could be accomplished within a reasonable time on a personal computer (i.e., similar to 3.5 hours for LRMW and similar to 10 hours for TAMW). We also showed that LRMW was suitable to detect interaction among a small number of genetic variants with moderate-to-strong marginal effect, while TAMW was useful to detect interaction among a larger number of low-marginal-effect genetic variants.

GENE-SPECIFIC PCR AMPLIFICATION OF TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT LACTOCOCCAL GENES	BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT			English	Article						citrate-permease; gene-specific PCR; Lactococcus lactis; integrase; proteinase		A set of gene-specific PCR techniques were used to characterize lactococcal cultures from the LBB collection. Initially the species identification of lactococci was confirmed by targeting the glutamate decarboxylase gene (gadB). PCR amplification of the genes for membrane proteinase (prtP) and citrate permease (citP) was used to select strains which grow rapidly in milk and/or ferment citrate. The prtP(+) and citP(+) phenotype was confirmed using differentiating microbiological media. It was proved that the citP(+) phenotype was always associated with strains of L. lactis ssp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis - an important aroma forming variety of dairy lactococci. In all diacetylactis strains the citP gene was localized on a 8.2 kbp plasmid. The lactococcal cultures were also tested for the presence of nisin synthesis (nisA/Z) genes. Potentially lysogenic lactococcal cultures which carry in their genome the gene of prophage integrase (int) were detected. From the tested strains nearly one third were int-positive. The thermal induction of prophage activity was demonstrated for the int(+) strain L. lactis ssp. lactis LBB.C1/6.

Traditional methods are predominantly focused on the analysis of interaction between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and an environmental variable. Given that genes are the functional units, it is crucial to understand how gene effects (rather than single SNP effects) are influenced by an environmental variable to affect disease risk. Motivated by the increasing awareness of the power of gene-based association analysis over single variant based approach, in this work, we proposed a sparse principle component regression (sPCR) model to understand the gene-based G x E interaction effect on complex disease. We first extracted the sparse principal components for SNPs in a gene, then the effect of each principal component was modeled by a varying-coefficient (VC) model. The model can jointly model variants in a gene in which their effects are nonlinearly influenced by an environmental variable. In addition, the varying-coefficient sPCR (VC-sPCR) model has nice interpretation property since the sparsity on the principal component loadings can tell the relative importance of the corresponding SNPs in each component. We applied our method to a human birth weight dataset in Thai population. We analyzed 12,005 genes across 22 chromosomes and found one significant interaction effect using the Bonferroni correction method and one suggestive interaction. The model performance was further evaluated through simulation studies. Our model provides a system approach to evaluate gene-based G x E interaction.

Existing tools try to address this using indirect features, such as expression levels and biochemical pathways. Here, we present Gene ORGANizer (geneorganizer.huji.ac.il), a phenotype-based tool that directly links human genes to the body parts they affect. It is built upon an exhaustive curated database that links >7000 genes to similar to 150 anatomical parts using >150 000 geneorgan associations. The tool offers user-friendly platforms to analyze the anatomical effects of individual genes, and identify trends within groups of genes. We demonstrate how Gene ORGANizer can be used to make new discoveries, showing that chromosome X is enriched with genes affecting facial features, that positive selection targets genes with more constrained phenotypic effects, and more. We expect Gene ORGANizer to be useful in a variety of evolutionary, medical and molecular studies aimed at understanding the phenotypic effects of genes.

In particular, the distributed genome hypothesis for bacteria states that the total number of genes present in a bacterial population is greater than the genome of every single individual. The pangenome, i.e. the set of all genes of a bacterial species (or a sample), comprises the core genes which are present in all living individuals, and accessory genes, which are carried only by some individuals. Bacteria have developed mechanisms in order to exchange genes horizontally, i.e. without a direct relationship. Here, we extend the infinitely many genes model from Baumdicker, Hess and Pfaffelhuber (2010) for such horizontal gene transfer. We take a genealogical view and give a construction - called the Ancestral Gene Transfer Graph - of the joint genealogy of all genes in the pangenome. As application, we compute moments of several statistics (e.g. the number of differences between two individuals and the gene frequency spectrum) under the infinitely many genes model with horizontal gene transfer.

The term 'gene doping' has been circulating in the media for several years now, presenting us the same pictures of genetically modified mice, that are twice the size of normal mice and heavily-muscled cattle resembling 'bovine body builders', over and over again. The topic gene doping is deprived of a solid scientific evaluation basis due to the jumble of terminology between molecular biology stem cell research, molecular pharmacology and gene therapy and is therefore ideal for journalists to come up with colorful speculations and fictional horror scenarios. Current gene therapy is still an experimental discipline and its applications in the near future will remain restricted to a particular segmentto to a few severe diseases. Undoubtedly, the hypothetical potential of gene therapeutic methods for misuse in improving athletics performance seems almost unlimited. However, at the current stage, any application outside a controlled clinical trial setting would carry considerable and unpredictable health risks. With this review, we aim to provide the interested reader with a synopsis of the current state of gene therapy and discuss the realistic possibilities, risks and consequences of the improper use of gene therapy research methods for performance enhancement in sports.

One particular challenge is to identify the main drivers and master regulatory genes that control such cell fate transitions. In this work, we reformulate this problem as the optimization problems of computing a Minimum Dominating Set and a Minimum Connected Dominating Set for directed graphs. Results: Both MDS and MCDS are applied to the well-studied gene regulatory networks of the model organisms E. coli and S. cerevisiae and to a pluripotency network for mouse embryonic stem cells. The results show that MCDS can capture most of the known key player genes identified so far in the model organisms. Moreover, this method suggests an additional small set of transcription factors as novel key players for governing the cell-specific gene regulatory network which can also be investigated with regard to diseases. To this aim, we investigated the ability of MCDS to define key drivers in breast cancer. The method identified many known drug targets as members of the MDS and MCDS. Conclusions: This paper proposes a new method to identify key player genes in gene regulatory networks.

J	Song, MS				Song, Minsun			Jackknife-based gene-gene interaction tests for untyped SNPs	BMC GENETICS			English	Article						Jackknife-based testing framework; Untyped SNP; Imputation-based testing; Gene-gene interaction	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LUNG-CANCER; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; GENOTYPE DATA; REGRESSION; DISEASES; MODEL; TUNA; MAP	Background: Testing gene-gene interaction in genome-wide association studies generally yields lower power than testing marginal association. Meta-analysis that combines different genotyping platforms is one method used to increase power when assessing gene-gene interactions, which requires a test for interaction on untyped SNPs. However, to date, formal statistical tests for gene-gene interaction on untyped SNPs have not been thoroughly addressed. The key concern for gene-gene interaction testing on untyped SNPs located on different chromosomes is that the pair of genes might not be independent and the current generation of imputation methods provides imputed genotypes at the marginal accuracy. Results: In this study we address this challenge and describe a novel method for testing gene-gene interaction on marginally imputed values of untyped SNPs. We show that our novel Wald-type test statistics for interactions with and without constraints in the interaction parameters follow the asymptotic distributions which are the same as those of the corresponding tests for typed SNPs. Through simulations, we show that the proposed tests properly control type I error and are more powerful than the extension of the classical dosage method to interaction tests. The increase in power results from a proper correction for the uncertainty in imputation through the variance estimator using the jackknife, one of resampling techniques. We apply the method to detect interactions between SNPs on chromosomes 5 and 15 on lung cancer data. The inclusion of the results at the untyped SNPs provides a much more detailed information at the regions of interest. Conclusions: As demonstrated by the simulation studies and real data analysis, our approaches outperform the application of traditional dosage method to detection of gene-gene interaction in terms of power while providing control of the type I error.

However, the cell membrane sets a barrier for the entry of nucleic acid molecules, and nucleic acids are easily degraded or neutralized when they are externally administered into the body. Carriers to encapsulate, protect and deliver nucleic acid molecules therefore are essential for clinical applications of gene therapy. The secreted organelles, exosomes, which naturally mediate the communications between cells, have been engineered to encapsulate and deliver nucleic acids to the desired tissues and cells. The fusion of exosomes with liposomes can increase the loading capacity and also retain the targeting capability of exosomes. Altogether, this review summarizes the most recent designs of exosome-based applications for gene delivery and their future perspectives in gene therapy.

Here we introduce a pair of mammalian synthetic gene circuits that linearly and orthogonally control the expression of two reporter genes in mammalian cells with low variability in response to chemical inducers introduced into the growth medium. These gene expression systems can be used to simultaneously probe the individual and joint effects of two gene product concentrations on a cellular phenotype in basic research or biomedical applications.

Recent studies have elucidated DHX30 and DDX3X as genes for which pathogenic variant alleles are involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. We hypothesized that variants in paralogous genes encoding members of the DExD/H-box RNA helicase superfamily might also underlie developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD and/or ID) disease phenotypes. Here we describe 15 unrelated individuals who have DD and/or ID, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, vertebral anomalies, and dysmorphic features and were found to have probably damaging variants in DExD/H-box RNA helicase genes. In addition, these individuals exhibit a variety of other tissue and organ system involvement including ocular, outer ear, hearing, cardiac, and kidney tissues. Five individuals with homozygous (one), compound-heterozygous (two), or de novo (two) missense variants in DHX37 were identified by exome sequencing. We identified ten total individuals with missense variants in three other DDX/DHX paralogs: DHX16 (four individuals), DDX54 (three individuals), and DHX34 (three individuals). Most identified variants are rare, predicted to be damaging, and occur at conserved amino acid residues. Taken together, these 15 individuals implicate the DExD/H-box helicases in both dominantly and recessively inherited neurodevelopmental phenotypes and highlight the potential for more than one disease mechanism underlying these disorders.

Fluorescent Gene Tagging of Transcriptionally Silent Genes in hiPSCs	STEM CELL REPORTS			English	Article							STEM-CELLS; TALENS	We describe a multistep method for endogenous tagging of transcriptionally silent genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). A monomeric EGFP (mEGFP) fusion tag and a constitutively expressed mCherry fluorescence selection cassette were delivered in tandem via homology-directed repair to five genes not expressed in hiPSCs but important for cardiomyocyte sarcomere function: TTN, MYL7, MYL2, TNNI1, and ACTN2. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to deliver the selection cassette and subsequently mediate its excision via microhomology-mediated end-joining and non-homologous end-joining. Most excised clones were effectively tagged, and all properly tagged clones expressed the mEGFP fusion protein upon differentiation into cardiomyocytes, allowing live visualization of these cardiac proteins at the sarcomere.

Because CF lung disease is currently the major cause of mortality and morbidity, and the lung airway is readily accessible to gene delivery, the major CF gene therapy effort at present is directed to the lung. Although airway epithelial cells are renewed slowly, permanent gene correction through gene editing or targeting in airway stem cells is needed to perpetuate the therapeutic effect. Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) has been utilized widely for a variety of gene editing applications. The stringent requirement for nuclease binding target sites allows for gene editing with precision. In this study, we engineered helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors to deliver a pair of TALENs together with donor DNA targeting the human AAVS1 locus. With homology arms of 4 kb in length, we demonstrated precise insertion of either a LacZ reporter gene or a human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) minigene (cDNA) into the target site. Using the LacZ reporter, we determined the efficiency of gene integration to be about 5%. In the CFTR vector transduced cells, we were able to detect CFTR mRNA expression using qPCR and function correction using fluorometric image plate reader (FLIPR) and iodide efflux assays. Taken together, these findings suggest a new direction for future in vitro and in vivo studies in CF gene editing.

Assigning Co-Regulated Human Genes and Regulatory Gene Clusters	CELLS			English	Article						expression quantitative trait loci; eQTL; colocalization; regulation of gene expression; co-regulation of gene expression	HOX GENES; CRISPR; TRANSCRIPTION; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; VARIANTS; TRAITS	Elucidating the role of genetic variation in the regulation of gene expression is key to understanding the pathobiology of complex diseases which, in consequence, is crucial in devising targeted treatment options. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis correlates a genetic variant with the strength of gene expression, thus defining thousands of regulated genes in a multitude of human cell types and tissues. Some eQTL may not act independently of each other but instead may be regulated in a coordinated fashion by seemingly independent genetic variants. To address this issue, we combined the approaches of eQTL analysis and colocalization studies. Gene expression was determined in datasets comprising 49 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. From about 33,000 regulated genes, over 14,000 were found to be co-regulated in pairs and were assembled across all tissues to almost 15,000 unique clusters containing up to nine regulated genes affected by the same eQTL signal. The distance of co-regulated eGenes was, on average, 112 kilobase pairs. Of 713 genes known to express clinical symptoms upon haploinsufficiency, 231 (32.4%) are part of at least one of the identified clusters. This calls for caution should treatment approaches aim at an upregulation of a haploinsufficient gene. In conclusion, we present an unbiased approach to identifying co-regulated genes in and across multiple tissues. Knowledge of such common effects is crucial to appreciate implications on biological pathways involved, specifically when a treatment option targets a co-regulated disease gene.

Construction of spatially controlled biosynthetic systems will facilitate the study of biological design principles. Herein, we fabricated a gene circuit compartment by coanchoring two function-related genes on surface of gold nanoparticles and investigated the compartment effect on cascade gene expression in a cell-free system. The gene circuit consisted of a T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) expression cassette as regulatory gene and a fluorescent protein expression cassette as regulated reporter gene. Both the expression cassettes were attached on a Y-shaped DNA nanostructure whose other two branches were mercapto-modified in order to steadily anchor the gene expression cassettes on the surface of gold nanoparticles. Experimental results demonstrated that both the yield and initial expression rate of the fluorescent reporter protein in the gene circuit compartment system were enhanced compared with those in free gene circuit system. Mechanism investigation revealed that the gene circuit compartment on nanoparticle made the regulatory gene and regulated reporter gene spatially proximal at nanoscale, thus effectively improving the transfer efficiency of the regulatory proteins (T7 RNAP) from regulatory genes to the regulated reporter genes in the compartments, and consequently, the biochemical reaction efficiency was significantly increased. This work not only provided a simplified model for rational molecular programming of genes circuit compartments on nanointerface but also presented implications for the cellular structure-function relationship.

Besides traditional logistic regression analysis for detecting interactions between two markers, new methods have been developed in recent years such as comparing linkage disequilibrium (LD) in case and control groups. All these methods form the building blocks of most screening strategies for disease susceptibility loci in GWAS. In this paper, we are interested in comparing the competing methods and providing practical guidelines for selecting appropriate testing methods for interaction in GWAS. We first review a series of existing statistical methods to detect interactions, and then examine different definitions of interactions to gain insight into the theoretical relationship between the existing testing methods. Lastly, we perform extensive simulations to compare powers of various methods to detect either interaction between two markers at two unlinked loci or the overall association allowing for both interaction and main effects. This investigation reveals informative characteristics of various methods that are helpful to GWAS investigators.

A key challenge is to select a few significant marker genes for biological studies. While it is feasible to find important genes from a single gene-expression data set, it is often more meaningful to compare the results from different but related data sets together, especially for multiple gene-expression data sets arising from different studies of a common organism or phenotype. In this paper, we present a novel framework to exploit the commonalities across different data sets by jointly learning from different data sets simultaneously through multi-task feature learning. By identifying a common subspace of genes, we can help biologists find important marker genes that span different evolutionary periods in the life cycle of cancer development. The genes thus found are more stable and more significant. Our experimental results demonstrate that more accurate models can be built using multiple data sets based on fewer labelled examples. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to introduce multi-task learning in the bioinformatics community to solve the lack of data problem.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have a successful portfolio in the treatment of chronic diseases. With the current progress in stem cells and gene therapy technologies, there is the promise of replacing costly mAbs production in bioreactors with a more direct and cost-effective production method inside the patient's cells. In this paper we examine the results of an investigational assessment of secukinumab gene therapy. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the DNA sequence of the heavy and light chains of secukinumab antibodies were cloned in a lentiviral vector. Human chorionic villous mesenchymal stem cells (CMSCs) were isolated and characterized. After lentiviral packaging and titration, part of the recombinant viruses was used for transduction of the CMSCs and the other part were applied for systemic gene therapy. The engineered stem cells and recombinant viruses were applied for ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy, respectively, in different groups of rat models. In vitro and in vivo secukinumab expression was confirmed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, and ELISA by considering the approved secukinumab as the standard reference. Results: Cell differentiation assays and flow cytometry of standard biomarkers confirmed the multipotency of the CMSCs. Western blot and qRT-PCR confirmed in vitro gene expression of secukinumab at both the mRNA and protein level. ELISA testing of serum from treated rat models confirmed mAb overexpression for both in vivo and ex vivo gene therapies. Conclusion: In this study, a lentiviral-mediated ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy was developed to provide a moderate dose of secukinumab in rat models. Biosimilar gene therapy is an attractive approach for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, cancers and other chronic diseases.

The genes encode single-pass membrane proteins and are located within chromosome 17q11.2-q12, a previously reported candidate region for PD. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs887231, rs887230 and rs4795942) located upstream and within TMEM132E showed a nominal significant association with PD primarily in the Danish cohort. No nominal significant associations were observed between TMEM98 and PD. Our data indicate that TMEM132E might contribute moderately towards the risk of developing PD.

J	Yu, ZX				Yu, Zhaoxia			Testing Gene-Gene Interactions in the Case-Parents Design	HUMAN HEREDITY			English	Article						Gene-gene interaction; Robustness; Population stratification; Linkage disequilibrium; Case-parents trios	FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES; SAMPLE; INDEPENDENCE; TRIADS; JOINT	The case-parents design has been widely used to detect genetic associations as it can prevent spurious association that could occur in population-based designs. When examining the effect of an individual genetic locus on a disease, logistic regressions developed by conditioning on parental genotypes provide complete protection from spurious association caused by population stratification. However, when testing gene-gene interactions, it is unknown whether conditional logistic regressions are still robust. Here we evaluate the robustness and efficiency of several gene-gene interaction tests that are derived from conditional logistic regressions. We found that in the presence of SNP genotype correlation due to population stratification or linkage disequilibrium, tests with incorrectly specified main-genetic-effect models can lead to inflated type I error rates. We also found that a test with fully flexible main genetic effects always maintains correct test size and its robustness can be achieved with negligible sacrifice of its power. When testing gene-gene interactions is the focus, the test allowing fully flexible main effects is recommended to be used. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

Many blinding diseases are associated with these mutations including Stargardt's disease (STGD1), cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and increased susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration. There are no curative treatments for any of these dsystrophies. While the monogenic nature of many of these conditions makes them amenable to treatment with gene therapy, the ABCA4 cDNA is 6.8 kb and is thus too large for the AAV vectors which have been most successful for other ocular genes. Here we review approaches to ABCA4 gene therapy including treatment with novel AAV vectors, lentiviral vectors, and non-viral compacted DNA nanoparticles. Lentiviral and compacted DNA nanoparticles in particular have a large capacity and have been successful in improving disease phenotypes in the Abca4-/-murine model. Excitingly, two Phase I/IIa clinical trials are underway to treat patients with ABCA4-associated Startgardt's disease (STGD1). As a result of the development of these novel technologies, effective therapies for ABCA4-associated diseases may finally be within reach.

This gene cluster has important roles in male fertility based on phenotypic defects of Rhox-mutant mice and the finding that aberrant RHOX promoter methylation is strongly associated with abnormal human sperm parameters. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of RHOX function in humans. Using gene expression profiling, we identified genes regulated by members of the human RHOX gene cluster. Some genes were uniquely regulated by RHOXF1 or RHOXF2/2B, while others were regulated by both of these transcription factors. Several of these regulated genes encode proteins involved in processes relevant to spermatogenesis; e.g. stress protection and cell survival. One of the target genes of RHOXF2/2B is RHOXF1, suggesting cross-regulation to enhance transcriptional responses. The potential role of RHOX in human infertility was addressed by sequencing all RHOX exons in a group of 250 patients with severe oligozoospermia. This revealed two mutations in RHOXF1 (c.515G>A and c.522C>T) and four in RHOXF2/2B (-73C>G,c.202G>A, c.411C>T and c.679G>A), of which only one (c.202G>A) was found in a control group of men with normal sperm concentration. Functional analysis demonstrated that c.202G>A and c.679G>A significantly impaired the ability of RHOXF2/2B to regulate downstream genes. Molecular modelling suggested that these mutations alter RHOXF2/F2B protein conformation. By combining clinical data with in vitro functional analysis, we demonstrate how the X-linked RHOX gene cluster may function in normal human spermatogenesis and we provide evidence that it is impaired in human male fertility.

Using regulatory variants to detect gene-gene interactions identifies networks of genes linked to cell immortalisation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; LACTATE-DEHYDROGENASE; CANCER; EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTION; ASSOCIATION; PROMOTES; MODELS; COHORT; SLFN5	The extent to which the impact of regulatory genetic variants may depend on other factors, such as the expression levels of upstream transcription factors, remains poorly understood. Here we report a framework in which regulatory variants are first aggregated into sets, and using these as estimates of the total cis-genetic effects on a gene we model their non-additive interactions with the expression of other genes in the genome. Using 1220 lymphoblastoid cell lines across platforms and independent datasets we identify 74 genes where the impact of their regulatory variant-set is linked to the expression levels of networks of distal genes. We show that these networks are predominantly associated with tumourigenesis pathways, through which immortalised cells are able to rapidly proliferate. We consequently present an approach to define gene interaction networks underlying important cellular pathways such as cell immortalisation. For most human genes nearby regulatory variants explain only a small proportion of their expression variation between individuals. Here the authors show how the impact of a gene's set of nearby regulatory variant is often linked to the expression levels of distal genes, providing insights into gene networks.

J	Han, H; Lee, S; Lee, I				Han, Heonjong; Lee, Sangyoung; Lee, Insuk			NGSEA: Network-Based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for Interpreting Gene Expression Phenotypes with Functional Gene Sets	MOLECULES AND CELLS			English	Article						drug repositioning; gene network; gene set enrichment analysis; network-based analysis; pathway analysis	SIGNATURES DATABASE; CONNECTIVITY MAP; ONTOLOGY	Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a popular tool to identify underlying biological processes in clinical samples using their gene expression phenotypes. GSEA measures the enrichment of annotated gene sets that represent biological processes for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in clinical samples. GSEA may be suboptimal for functional gene sets; however, because DEGs from the expression dataset may not be functional genes per se but dysregulated genes perturbed by bona fide functional genes. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed network-based GSEA (NGSEA), which measures the enrichment score of functional gene sets using the expression difference of not only individual genes but also their neighbors in the functional network. We found that NGSEA outperformed GSEA in identifying pathway gene sets for matched gene expression phenotypes. We also observed that NGSEA substantially improved the ability to retrieve known anti-cancer drugs from patient-derived gene expression data using drug-target gene sets compared with another method, Connectivity Map. We also repurposed FDA-approved drugs using NGSEA and experimentally validated budesonide as a chemical with anti-cancer effects for colorectal cancer. We, therefore, expect that NGSEA will facilitate both pathway interpretation of gene expression phenotypes and anti-cancer drug repositioning. NGSEA is freely available at www.inetbio.org/ngsea.

However, there is a lack of information on actin gene in the family Arcidae, including Anadara granosa. The objective of this research was to explore actin gene expression and characteristic from A. granosa induced by mercury. Blood cockle samples were acclimatized for two days prior to HgCl2 exposure. Concentrations of HgCl2 used were 0, 1, 2, and 10 mg/l. Samples were subjected to HgCl2 for 0-48 h. Following induction, samples were dissected and isolated to collect RNA samples. Intact RNA samples were reverse transcibed and amplified using PCR method. PCR products were then sequenced. The expression of actin gene was constant despite variation in mercury concentration. A 353 bp fragment of AgACT cDNA was successfully amplified. As compared to other actin gene sequences from other molluscs, distinct sequences were observed. Hence, the actin gene from A. granosa is specific and can be utilized as housekeeping gene in future gene expression studies.

Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNMTI, DNMT3A and DNMT3B were selected and genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction combined with ligase detection reaction method (PCR-LDR). A total of 685 Graves' disease (GD) patients, 353 Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) patients and 909 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Epistasis was tested by additive model, multiplicative model and general multifactor dimensionality reduction (general MDR). Rs2424913 (DNMT3B) and rs2228611 (DNMT1) were associated with susceptibility to AITD and GD in the dominant and overdominant model, respectively (rs2424913: P=0.009 for AITD, P=0.0041 for GD; rs2228611: P=0.035 for AITD, P=0.043 for GD). Multiplicative and multiple high dimensional gene-gene or gene-sex interactions were also observed in this study. We have found evidence for a potential role of rs2424913 (DNMT3B) and rs2228611 (DNMT1) in AITD susceptibility and identified novel gene gene/gene-sex interactions in AITD. Our study may highlight sex and genes of DNMTs family as contributors to the pathogenesis of AITD.

This study aims to investigate interactions involving these genes and macronutrient intakes affecting obesity-related phenotypes. Methods: We used a traditional statistical method, logistic regression, and compared it to alternative statistical method, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and penalized logistic regression (PLR), to better detect genes/environment interactions in the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study (n = 1639) using dichotomized body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference as obesity-related phenotypes. Exposure variables included genotype on 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (NFKB1: 18, IKBKB: 9, SOCS3: 27), macronutrient (carbohydrates, protein, fat) and alcohol intakes and ethno-cultural background. Results: After correction for multiple testing, no interaction was found using logistic regression. MDR identified interactions between SOCS3 rs6501199 and rs4969172, and IKBKB rs3747811 affecting BMI in the Caucasian population; SOCS3 rs6501199 and NFKB1 rs1609798 affecting WC in the Caucasian population; and SOCS3 rs4436839 and IKBKB rs3747811 affecting WC in the South Asian population. PLR found a main effect of SOCS3 rs12944581 on BMI among the South Asian population. Conclusion: While MDR and PLR had discordant results, some models support results from previous studies. These results emphasize the need to use alternative statistical methods to investigate high-order interactions and suggest that variants in the nutrient-responsive hypothalamic IKKB/NF-kB signaling pathway may be involved in obesity pathogenesis.

The dimensionality reduction approaches are a promising tool for this task. Many complex diseases exhibit composite syndromes required to be measured in a cluster of clinical traits with varying correlations and/or are inherently longitudinal in nature (changing over time and measured dynamically at multiple time points). A multivariate approach for detecting interactions is thus greatly needed on the purposes of handling a multifaceted phenotype and longitudinal data, as well as improving statistical power for multiple significance testing via a two-stage testing procedure that involves a multivariate analysis for grouped phenotypes followed by univariate analysis for the phenotypes in the significant group(s). In this article, we propose a multivariate extension of generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) based on multivariate generalized linear, multivariate quasi-likelihood and generalized estimating equations models. Simulations and real data analysis for the cohort from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment are performed to investigate the properties and performance of the proposed method, as compared with the univariate method. The results suggest that the proposed multivariate GMDR substantially boosts statistical power.

Gene-Gene Interplay and Gene-Diet Interactions Involving the MTNR1B rs10830963 Variant with Body Weight Loss	JOURNAL OF NUTRIGENETICS AND NUTRIGENOMICS			English	Article						MTNR1B; FTO; MC4R; Obesity; Body weight loss; Gene-gene interplay; Gene-diet interaction	LOSS STRATEGIES; MACRONUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION; MELANOCORTIN-4 RECEPTOR; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; METABOLIC SYNDROME; FAT DISTRIBUTION; INSULIN-RELEASE; INCREASED RISK; OBESITY; FTO	Background/Aims: Investigation of the genetic makeup may facilitate the implementation of more personalized nutritional interventions. The aims were to examine whether the rs10830963 MTNR1B polymorphism affects weight loss in response to a hypocaloric diet and to find potential gene-gene interplays and gene-diet interactions. Methods: 167 subjects enrolled in a personalized nutritional intervention for weight loss (3-6 weeks) were examined for anthropometric measurements, dietary habits and physical activity at baseline and at the first follow-up visit. Three polymorphisms, which have previously been associated with body weight regulation, rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs9939609 (FTO) and rs17782313 (MC4R), were analyzed using the Luminex (R) 100/200 (TM) System. Results: After adjusting for covariates, females with the rs10830963 CG/GG genotype showed lower weight loss than those with the CC genotype. In the total population, carriers of variant alleles of both FTO and MC4R showed a significant association with MTNR1B and weight loss outcome. Moreover, among women, higher total protein and animal protein intakes were associated with a lower weight loss in G allele carriers of the MTNR1B variant. Conclusions: Our data evidenced that rs10830963 MTNR1B polymorphism could be associated with individual differences in weight loss induced by a hypocaloric diet. This association was influenced by FTO and MC4R loci and modified by baseline protein intake. (C) 2015 S.

Trait deployment by gene stacking would greatly simplify downstream plant breeding and trait introgression into cultivars. Gene stacking into pre-determined genomic sites depends on mechanisms of targeted DNA integration and recycling of selectable marker genes. Targeted integrations into chromosomal breaks, created by nucleases, require large transformation efforts. Recombinases such as Cre-lox, on the other hand, efficiently drive site-specific integrations in plants. However, the reversibility of Cre-lox recombination, due to the incorporation of two cis-positioned lox sites, presents a major bottleneck in its application in gene stacking. Here, we describe a strategy of resolving this bottleneck through excision of one of the cis-positioned lox, embedded in the marker gene, by nuclease activity. Methods: All transgenic lines were developed by particle bombardment of rice callus with plasmid constructs. Standard molecular approach was used for building the constructs. Transgene loci were analyzed by PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing. Results: We developed a highly efficient gene stacking method by utilizing powerful recombinases such as Cre-lox and FLP-FRT, for site-specific gene integrations, and nucleases for marker gene excisions. We generated Cremediated site-specific integration locus in rice and showed excision of marker gene by I-SceI at similar to 20 % efficiency, seamlessly connecting genes in the locus. Next, we showed ZFN could be used for marker excision, and the locus can be targeted again by recombinases. Hence, we extended the power of recombinases to gene stacking application in plants. Finally, we show that heat-inducible I-SceI is also suitable for marker excision, and therefore could serve as an important tool in streamlining this gene stacking platform. Conclusions: A practical approach for gene stacking in plant cell was developed that allows targeted gene insertions through rounds of transformation, a method needed for introducing new traits into transgenic lines for their rapid deployment in the field. By using Cre-lox, a powerful site-specific recombination system, this method greatly improves gene stacking efficiency, and through the application of nucleases develops marker-free, seamless stack of genes at pre-determined chromosomal sites.

J	Cao, RZ; Cheng, JL				Cao, Renzhi; Cheng, Jianlin			Deciphering the association between gene function and spatial gene-gene interactions in 3D human genome conformation	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							SIMILARITY ANALYSIS; ORGANIZATION; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; NETWORK	Background: A number of factors have been investigated in the context of gene function prediction and analysis, such as sequence identity, gene expressions, and gene co-evolution. However, three-dimensional (3D) conformation of the genome has not been tapped to analyse gene function, probably largely due to lack of genome conformation data until recently. Methods: We construct the genome-wide spatial gene-gene interaction networks for three different human B-cells or cell lines from their chromosomal contact data generated by the Hi-C chromosome conformation capturing technique. The G-SESAME and Fast-SemSim are used to calculate function similarity between interacted / non-interacted genes. The Gene Ontology statistics computed from the gene-gene interaction networks is used for gene function prediction. Results: We compare the function similarity of gene pairs that do not spatially interact and that have interactions. We find that genes that have strong spatial interactions tend to have highly similar function in terms of biological process, molecular function and cellular component of the Gene Ontology. And even though the level of gene-gene interactions generally have no or weak correlation with either sequential genomic distance or sequence identity between genes, the interacted genes with high function similarity tend to have stronger interactions, somewhat shorter genomic distance and significantly higher sequence identity. And combining genomic distance or sequence identity with spatial gene-gene interaction information informs gene-gene function similarity much better than using either one of them alone, suggesting gene-gene interaction information is largely complementary with genomic distance and sequence identity in the context of gene function analysis. We develop and evaluate a new gene function prediction method based on gene-gene interacting networks, which can predict gene function well for a large number of human genes.

However, certain biological features tend to be overlooked in evaluating a gene's popularity. Here we present a meta-analysis of the reasons why different genes have been studied and to what extent, with a focus on the gene-specific biological features. From unbiased datasets we can define biological properties of genes that reasonably may affect their perceived importance. We make use of both linear and nonlinear computational approaches for estimating gene popularity to then compare their relative importance. We find that roughly 25% of the studies are the result of a historical positive feedback, which we may think of as social reinforcement. Of the remaining features, gene family membership is the most indicative followed by disease relevance and finally regulatory pathway association. Disease relevance has been an important driver until the 1990s, after which the focus shifted to exploring every single gene. We also present a resource that allows one to study the impact of reinforcement, which may guide our research toward genes that have not yet received proportional attention.

The most common cause of GC is the infection of Helicobacter pylori, approximately 11% of cases are caused by genetic factors. The objective of this study was to develop an effective computational method to meaningfully interpret these GC-related genes and to predict potential prognostic genes for clinical detection. Methods: We employed the shortest path algorithm and permutation test to probe the genes that have relationship with known GC genes in gene-gene interaction network. We calculated the enrichment scores of gene ontology and pathways of gastric cancer related genes to characterize these genes in terms of molecular features. The optimal features that primly representing the gastric cancer related genes were selected using Random Forest classification and incremental feature selection. Random Forest classification was also used for the prediction of the novel gastric cancer related genes based on the selected features and the identification of novel prognostic genes based on the expression of genes. Results: Based on the shortest path analysis of 36 known GC genes, 39 genes occurring in shortest path were identified as GC-related genes. In subsequent classification, 4153 gene ontology terms and 157 pathway terms were identified as the optimal features to depict these gastric cancer related genes. Based on them, a total of 886 genes were predicted as related genes. These 886 genes could serve as expression biomarkers for clinical detection and they achieved a 100% accuracy for distinguishing gastric cancer from a case-control dataset, better than any of 886 random selected genes did. Conclusion: By analyzing the features of known GC-related genes, we employed a systematic method to predict gastric cancer related genes and novel prognostic genes for accurate clinical detection.

Interactions between genes of importance to cardiovascular regulation may account for some of the missing heritability of CAD. This study aimed to investigate the role of gene-gene interactions in common variants in candidate cardiovascular genes in CAD. Approach and Results 2,101 patients with CAD from the British Heart Foundation Family Heart Study and 2,426 CAD-free controls were included in the discovery cohort. All subjects were genotyped with the Illumina HumanCVD BeadChip enriched for genes and pathways relevant to the cardiovascular system and disease. The primary analysis in the discovery cohort examined pairwise interactions among 913 common (minor allele frequency >0.1) independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with at least nominal association with CAD in single locus analysis. A secondary exploratory interaction analysis was performed among all 11,332 independent common SNPs surviving quality control criteria. Replication analyses were conducted in 2,967 patients and 3,075 controls from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium. None of the interactions amongst 913 SNPs analysed in the primary analysis was statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (required P<1.2x10(-7)). Similarly, none of the pairwise gene-gene interactions in the secondary analysis reached statistical significance after correction formultiple testing (required P = 7.8x10(-10)). None of 36 suggestive interactions from the primary analysis or 31 interactions from the secondary analysis was significant in the replication cohort. Our study had 80% power to detect odds ratios >1.7 for common variants in the primary analysis. Conclusions Moderately large additive interactions between common SNPs in genes relevant to cardiovascular disease do not appear to play a major role in genetic predisposition to CAD. The role of genetic interactions amongst less common SNPs and with medium and small magnitude effects remain to be investigated.

Environmental factors such as education and time outdoors also demonstrate strong associations. Currently however, the extent of gene-environment or gene-gene interactions in myopia is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that refractive error-associated variants exhibit effect size heterogeneity, a hallmark feature of genetic interactions. Of 146 variants tested, evidence of non-uniform, non-linear effects were observed for 66 (45%) at Bonferroni-corrected significance (P < 1.1 x 10(-4)) and 128 (88%) at nominal significance (P < 0.05). LAMA2 variant rs12193446, for example, had an effect size varying from -0.20 diopters (95% CI - 0.18 to -0.23) to -0.89 diopters (95% CI -0.71 to -1.07) in different individuals. SNP effects were strongest at the phenotype extremes and weaker in emmetropes. A parsimonious explanation for these findings is that gene-environment or gene-gene interactions in myopia are pervasive.

Optimal models of gene-gene interactions were formed. The six-locus model was the most significant: (ApoA1(+83T), ApoA1(-75A), ApoB(Del), ApoC3(S2), ApoE(epsilon 2), ApoE(epsilon 4). The maximum synergism in both adolescent groups were shown for allele variants ApoA1(-75A), ApoB(Del), and ApoE(epsilon 4). The maximum contribution to gene-gene interactions entropy was made by allelic polymorphisms ApoA1(-75A) and ApoE(epsilon 4) and (in the comorbid pathology group) for ApoE(epsilon 4)+ApoB(Del).

J	Wei, PJ; Zhang, D; Xia, JF; Zheng, CH				Wei, Pi-Jing; Zhang, Di; Xia, Junfeng; Zheng, Chun-Hou			LNDriver: identifying driver genes by integrating mutation and expression data based on gene-gene interaction network	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th International Conference on Genome Informatics - Bioinformatics	OCT 03-05, 2016	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA			Cancer; Driver genes; Mutation data; Expression data; Interaction network	SOMATIC MUTATION; BREAST-CANCER; PATHWAYS; HEAD; RB1; SRC	Background: Cancer is a complex disease which is characterized by the accumulation of genetic alterations during the patient's lifetime. With the development of the next-generation sequencing technology, multiple omics data, such as cancer genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data etc., can be measured from each individual. Correspondingly, one of the key challenges is to pinpoint functional driver mutations or pathways, which contributes to tumorigenesis, from millions of functional neutral passenger mutations. Results: In this paper, in order to identify driver genes effectively, we applied a generalized additive model to mutation profiles to filter genes with long length and constructed a new gene-gene interaction network. Then we integrated the mutation data and expression data into the gene-gene interaction network. Lastly, greedy algorithm was used to prioritize candidate driver genes from the integrated data. We named the proposed method Length-Net-Driver ( LNDriver). Conclusions: Experiments on three TCGA datasets, i.e., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, demonstrated that the proposed method was effective. Also, it can identify not only frequently mutated drivers, but also rare candidate driver genes.

SYMPHONY, an information-theoretic method for gene-gene and gene-environment interaction analysis of disease syndromes	HEREDITY			English	Article						gene-environment interactions; gene-gene interactions; K-way interaction information; syndromes; complex diseases	MULTIFACTOR-DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; LINKAGE	We develop an information-theoretic method for gene-gene (GGI) and gene-environmental interactions (GEI) analysis of syndromes, defined as a phenotype vector comprising multiple quantitative traits (QTs). The K-way interaction information (KWII), an information-theoretic metric, was derived for multivariate normal distributed phenotype vectors. The utility of the method was challenged with three simulated data sets, the Genetic Association Workshop-15 (GAW15) rheumatoid arthritis data set, a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and atherosclerosis data set from a mouse QT locus study, and the 1000 Genomes data. The dependence of the KWII on effect size, minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, population stratification/admixture, as well as the power and computational time requirements of the novel method was systematically assessed in simulation studies. In these studies, phenotype vectors containing two and three constituent multivariate normally distributed QTs were used and the KWII was found to be effective at detecting GEI associated with the phenotype. High KWII values were observed for variables and variable combinations associated with the syndrome phenotype compared with uninformative variables not associated with the phenotype. The KWII values for the phenotype-associated combinations increased monotonically with increasing effect size values. The KWII also exhibited utility in simulations with non-linear dependence between the constituent QTs. Analysis of the HDL and atherosclerosis data set indicated that the simultaneous analysis of both phenotypes identified interactions not detected in the analysis of the individual traits. The information-theoretic approach may be useful for non-parametric analysis of GGI and GEI of complex syndromes.

Materials & methods: GRIN1 rs11146020 (G1001C), GRIN2A GI-repeat and GRIN2B rs10193895 (G-200T) polymorphisms were tested for association in a Caucasian (n = 183) and an African American (n = 49) sample using chi(2) and ANOVA tests. Logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to explore gene gene interaction effects with dopamine receptor gene variants. Results & conclusion: This study does not support the involvement of the NMDA receptor subunit gene polymorphisms in clozapine response. All tests for an association were negative. Gene gene interaction analyses however yielded promising leads, including an observed effect between DRD1 rs686 and DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphisms on clozapine response (p = 0.002).

The Influence of Pharmacogenetics on the Clinical Relevance of Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug-Gene, Drug-Gene-Gene and Drug-Drug-Gene Interactions	PHARMACEUTICALS			English	Review						drug-drug interactions; drug-gene interactions; drug-g-gene interactions; phenoconversion; pharmacogenetics	CYP2D6 GENOTYPE; PHENOCONVERSION; POLYMORPHISMS; INHIBITION; CYP2C19; IMPACT; SAMPLE	Drug interactions are a well-known cause of adverse drug events, and drug interaction databases can help the clinician to recognize and avoid such interactions and their adverse events. However, not every interaction leads to an adverse drug event. This is because the clinical relevance of drug-drug interactions also depends on the genetic profile of the patient. If inhibitors or inducers of drug metabolising enzymes (e.g., CYP and UGT) are added to the drug therapy, phenoconcversion can occur. This leads to a genetic phenotype that mismatches the observable phenotype. Drug-drug-gene and drug-gene-gene interactions influence the toxicity and/or ineffectivness of the drug therapy. To date, there have been limited published studies on the impact of genetic variations on drug-drug interactions. This review discusses the current evidence of drug-drug-gene interactions, as well as drug-gene-gene interactions. Phenoconversion is explained, the and methods to calculate the phenotypes are described. Clinical recommendations are given regarding the integratation of the PGx results in the assessment of the relevance of drug interactions in the future.

Results: GC risk was significantly higher in carriers of G allele of rs2736100 than those with TT genotype (TG+ GG versus TT), adjusted OR (95% CI) = 1.68 (1.26-2.17), and higher in carriers of G allele of 3rs2853669 than those with AA genotype (AG+GG versus AA), adjusted OR (95% CI) = 1.72 (1.19-2.33). We also found that interaction between rs2736100 and smoking was associated with higher GC risk. Smokers with TG or GG of rs2736100 genotype have elevated GC risk, compared to never-smokers with TT of rs2736100 genotype, OR (95% CI) = 3.12 (1.82 -4.61). Pairwise linkage equilibrium (LD) analysis between SNPs was measured and the D' value between rs2736100 and rs2736109 was more than 0.8. A haplotype containing the rs2736100G and rs2736109-A alleles was associated with a statistically increased GC risk (OR=2.66, 95% CI= 1.28 -4.12, p<0.0001). Materials and Methods: A total of 1088 participants (686 males, 402 females) were selected, including 360 GC patients and 728 normal participants. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TERT gene and GC susceptibility. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) model was used to screen gene-gene and gene-environment interaction combinations. Conclusions: We found that G allele of rs2736100 and G allele of rs2853669 in TERT gene, interaction between rs2736100 and smoking, and haplotype containing the rs2736100-G and rs2736109-A alleles were all associated with increased GC risk.

Evolutionary changes-by definition, changes in DNA sequence-can lead to even more dramatic postponement of age-dependent deterioration. Genetic variation within a species, for example among breeds of dogs, can also lead to major changes in aging rate, although there is not yet any strong evidence for similar genetic variation that modulates aging in rodents or humans. This essay compares different strategies for using genetic information to clarify questions in biogerontology, suggesting an emphasis on genes that can retard multiple forms of age-dependent dysfunction in parallel.

Compared to previous studies which have focused on the primary function of U1 snRNA and the neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormalities of U1 snRNA, this study is to investigate how U1 snRNA over-expression affects the expression of mammal genes on a genome-wide scale. By comparing the gene expression profiles of U1 snRNA over-expressed cells with those of their controls using microarray experiments, 916 genes or loci were identified significantly Differentially Expressed (DE). These 595 up-regulated DE genes and 321 down-regulated DE genes were analyzed using annotations from GO categories and pathways from the KEGG database. As a result, three of 12 enriched pathways were well-known cancer pathways, while the other nine pathways were associated to cancers in previous studies.

Here, we used various epigenome profiles from human myoblasts (Mb), myotubes (Mt), muscle and diverse non-muscle samples to elucidate the involvement of multigene neighborhoods in the regulation of MRF genes. We found more far-distal enhancer chromatin associated with MRF genes in Mb and Mt than previously reported from studies in mice. For the MYF5/MYF6 gene-pair, regions of Mb-associated enhancer chromatin were located throughout the adjacent 236-kb PTPRQ gene even though Mb expressed negligible amounts of PTPRQ mRNA. Some enhancer chromatin regions inside PTPRQ in Mb were also seen in PTPRQ mRNA-expressing non-myogenic cells. This suggests dual-purpose PTPRQ enhancers that upregulate expression of PTPRQ in non-myogenic cells and MYF5/MYF6 in myogenic cells. In contrast, the myogenic enhancer chromatin regions distal to MYOD1 were intergenic and up to 19 kb long. Two of them contain small, known MYOD1 enhancers, and one displayed an unusually high level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in a quantitative DNA hydroxymethylation assay. Unexpectedly, three regions of MYOD1-distal enhancer chromatin in Mb and Mt overlapped enhancer chromatin in umbilical vein endothelial cells, which might upregulate a distant gene (PIK3C2A). Lastly, genes surrounding MYOG were preferentially transcribed in Mt, like MYOG itself, and exhibited nearby myogenic enhancer chromatin. These neighboring chromatin regions may be enhancers acting in concert to regulate myogenic expression of multiple adjacent genes. Our findings reveal the very different and complex organization of gene neighborhoods containing closely related transcription factor genes.

These candidate genes were identified as having single variants of likely pathogenic significance discovered in a large-scale massively parallel sequencing study. Candidate Epileptic Encephalopathy genes were prioritized according to their co-expression with 29 known Epileptic Encephalopathy genes. We utilized developing brain and adult brain gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) and compared this to data from Celsius: a large, heterogeneous gene expression data warehouse. We show replicable prioritization results using these three independent gene expression resources, two of which are brain-specific, with small sample size, and the third derived from a heterogeneous collection of tissues with large sample size. Of the nineteen genes that we predicted with the highest likelihood to be true Epileptic Encephalopathy genes, two (GNAO1 and GRIN2B) have recently been independently reported and confirmed. We compare our results to those produced by an established in silico prioritization approach called Endeavour, and finally present gene expression networks for the known and candidate Epileptic Encephalopathy genes. This highlights sub-networks of gene expression, particularly in the network derived from the adult AHBA gene expression dataset. These networks give clues to the likely biological interactions between Epileptic Encephalopathy genes, potentially highlighting underlying mechanisms and avenues for therapeutic targets.

Methods for large-scale interactions analysis have been under development from several sources. Due to several difficult issues (e. g., sparseness of data in high dimensions and low replication or validation rate), development of fast, powerful and robust methods for detecting various forms of gene-gene interactions continues to be a challenging task. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this article, we have developed an evolution-based method to search for genome-wide epistasis in a case-control design. From an evolutionary perspective, we view that human diseases originate from ancient mutations and consider that the underlying genetic variants play a role in differentiating human population into the healthy and the diseased. Based on this concept, traditional evolutionary measure, fixation index (Fst) for two unlinked loci, which measures the genetic distance between populations, should be able to reveal the responsible genetic interplays for disease traits. To validate our proposal, we first investigated the theoretical distribution of Fst by using extensive simulations. Then, we explored its power for detecting gene-gene interactions via SNP markers, and compared it with the conventional Pearson Chi-square test, mutual information based test and linkage disequilibrium based test under several disease models. The proposed evolution-based method outperformed these compared methods in dominant and additive models, no matter what the disease allele frequencies were. However, its performance was relatively poor in a recessive model. Finally, we applied the proposed evolution-based method to analysis of a published dataset. Our results showed that the P value of the Fst -based statistic is smaller than those obtained by the LD-based statistic or Poisson regression models. Conclusions/Significance: With rapidly growing large-scale genetic association studies, the proposed evolution-based method can be a promising tool in the identification of epistatic effects.

J	Jiang, X; Zhang, H; Quan, XW				Jiang, Xue; Zhang, Han; Quan, Xiongwen			Differentially Coexpressed Disease Gene Identification Based on Gene Coexpression Network	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							EXPRESSED GENES; METAANALYSIS	Screening disease-related genes by analyzing gene expression data has become a popular theme. Traditional disease-related gene selection methods always focus on identifying differentially expressed gene between case samples and a control group. These traditional methods may not fully consider the changes of interactions between genes at different cell states and the dynamic processes of gene expression levels during the disease progression. However, in order to understand the mechanism of disease, it is important to explore the dynamic changes of interactions between genes in biological networks at different cell states. In this study, we designed a novel framework to identify disease-related genes and developed a differentially coexpressed disease-related gene identification method based on gene coexpression network (DCGN) to screen differentially coexpressed genes. We firstly constructed phase-specific gene coexpression network using time-series gene expression data and defined the conception of differential coexpression of genes in coexpression network. Then, we designed two metrics tomeasure the value of gene differential coexpression according to the change of local topological structures between different phase-specific networks. Finally, we conducted meta-analysis of gene differential coexpression based on the rank-product method. Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of DCGN and the superior performance of DCGN over other popular disease-related gene selection methods through real-world gene expression data sets.

Currently, one of the challenges is to identify the molecular downstream effects of these variants. Although several SCNAs are known to change gene expression levels, it is not clear whether each individual SCNA affects gene expression. We reanalyzed 77,840 expression profiles and observed a limited set of 'transcriptional components' that describe well-known biology, explain the vast majority of variation in gene expression and enable us to predict the biological function of genes. On correcting expression profiles for these components, we observed that the residual expression levels (in 'functional genomic mRNA' profiling) correlated strongly with copy number. DNA copy number correlated positively with expression levels for 99% of all abundantly expressed human genes, indicating global gene dosage sensitivity. By applying this method to 16,172 patient-derived tumor samples, we replicated many loci with aberrant copy numbers and identified recurrently disrupted genes in genomically unstable cancers.

A reverse engineering technique, Bayesian Model Averaging-based Networks (BMAnet), which ensembles all appropriate linear models to tackle uncertainty in model selection that integrates heterogeneous biological data sets is introduced. Using network evaluation metrics, we compare the networks that are thus identified. The metric 'Random walk with restart (Rwr)' is utilised to search for disease genes. In a simulation our method shows better performance than elastic-net and Gaussian graphical models, but topological quantities vary among the three methods. Using real-data, brain tumour gene expression samples consisting of non-tumour, grade III and grade IV are analysed to estimate networks with a total of 4422 genes. Based on these networks, 169 brain tumour-related candidate genes were identified and some were found to relate to 'wound', 'apoptosis', and 'cell death' processes.

Selection of the proper reference genes is very important when calibrating the results of real-time quantitative PCR. Studies on the selection of reference genes in goat tissues are limited, despite the economic importance of their meat and dairy products. We used real-time quantitative PCR to detect the expression levels of eight reference gene candidates (18S, TBP, HMBS, YWHAZ, ACTB, HPRT1, GAPDH and EEF1A2) in ten tissues types sourced from Boer goats. The optimal reference gene combination was selected according to the results determined by geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper software packages. The analyses showed that tissue is an important variability factor in genes expression stability. When all tissues were considered, 18S, TBP and HMBS is the optimal reference combination for calibrating quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression from goat tissues. Dividing data set by tissues, ACTB was the most stable in stomach, small intestine and ovary, 18S in heart and spleen, HMBS in uterus and lung, TBP in liver, HPRT1 in kidney and GAPDH in muscle. Overall, this study provided valuable information about the goat reference genes that can be used in order to perform a proper normalisation when relative quantification by qRT-PCR studies is undertaken.

A number of approaches to infer gene networks and various software tools to handle them in a visual simplified way have been developed recently. However, there is still a need to assess the inferred networks in order to prove their relevance. Results: In this paper, we present the new GNC-app for Cytoscape. GNC-app implements the GNC methodology for assessing the biological coherence of gene association networks and integrates it into Cytoscape. implemented de novo, GNC-app significantly improves the performance of the original algorithm in order to be able to analyse large gene networks more efficiently. It has also been integrated in Cytoscape to increase the tool accessibility for non-technical users and facilitate the visual analysis of the results. This integration allows the user to analyse not only the global biological coherence of the network, but also the biological coherence at the gene-gene relationship level. It also allows the user to leverage Cytoscape capabilities as well as its rich ecosystem of apps to perform further analyses and visualizations of the network using such data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While both organelles have retained substantial proteomic and biochemical complexity, this complexity is not reflected in the content of their genomes. Instead, the organellar genomes encode fewer than 5% of the genes found in living relatives of their ancestors. While many of the 95% of missing organellar genes have been discarded, others have been transferred to the host nuclear genome through a process known as endosymbiotic gene transfer. Results Here, we demonstrate that the difference in the per-cell copy number of the organellar and nuclear genomes presents an energetic incentive to the cell to either delete organellar genes or transfer them to the nuclear genome. We show that, for the majority of transferred organellar genes, the energy saved by nuclear transfer exceeds the costs incurred from importing the encoded protein into the organelle where it can provide its function. Finally, we show that the net energy saved by endosymbiotic gene transfer can constitute an appreciable proportion of total cellular energy budgets and is therefore sufficient to impart a selectable advantage to the cell. Conclusion Thus, reduced cellular cost and improved energy efficiency likely played a role in the reductive evolution of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes and the transfer of organellar genes to the nuclear genome.

However, neither gene transfer nor gene editing techniques have been established in sturgeon for molecular breeding and gene functional study until now. In this study, we accomplished gene transfer and gene editing in sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), which has the shortest sexual maturation period of sturgeons. The plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was transferred into the embryos of sterlet at injection concentration of 100 ng/mu L, under which condition high survival rate and gene transfer rate could be achieved. Subsequently, exogenous EGFP was efficiently disrupted by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease/guide RNA (gRNA), with injection concentrations of 300 ng/mu L TALENs, or 100 ng/mu L Cas9 nuclease and 30 ng/mu L gRNA, respectively, under which condition high survival rate and gene mutation rate could be achieved. Finally, the endogenous gene no tail in sterlet was successfully mutated by Cas9 nuclease/gRNA. We observed the CRISPR-induced no tail mutation, at a high efficiency with the mutant P0 embryos displaying the expected phenotype of bent spine and twisted tail.

We analyse how the variation in gene copy number and the mutations changing the auto-regulation strength affect the steady-state distribution of protein concentration. We predict that one-reporter assay, an experimental method where the extrinsic noise level is inferred from the comparison of expression variance of a single and duplicated reporter gene, may give an incorrect estimation of the extrinsic noise contribution when applied to self-regulating genes. We also show that an imperfect duplication of an auto-activated gene, changing the regulation strength of one of the copies, may lead to a hybrid, binary+graded response of these genes to external signal. The analysis of relative changes in mean gene expression before and after duplication suggests that evolutionary accumulation of gene duplications may, at a given mean burst size, non-trivially depend on the inherent noisiness of a given gene, quantified by the inverse of the maximal mean frequency of bursts. Moreover, we find that the dependence of gene expression noise on gene copy number and auto regulation strength may qualitatively differ, e.g. in monotonicity, depending on whether the noise is measured by Fano factor or coefficient of variation. Thus, experimentally-based hypotheses linking gene expression noise and evolutionary optimisation in the context of gene copy number variation may be ambiguous as they are dependent on the particular function chosen to quantify noise.

Shiga toxin-encoding genes (stx genes) in human faecal samples. APMIS 2013; 121: 202-10. The aim of the two studies reported here was to investigate the distribution of stx genes in human faecal samples from volunteers and in faecal samples submitted to a regional microbiology hospital laboratory, and to isolate and characterize STEC from stx-positive samples. In total, faecal samples from 13.9% of 165 volunteers and 36.1% of 416 swabs from the regional microbiology hospital laboratory were positive for stx genes after screening by PCR. Isolation of STEC and of E. coli O157 from stx-positive faecal samples was performed by a filter-hybridization protocol and by automated immunomagnetic separation, respectively, and isolates were further characterized by serotyping, virulence typing by PCR and toxin production by the Vero cell assay. STEC were isolated from two samples only, an O146:H21 isolate from one of the volunteers and an O157:H7 isolate from a human case of diarrhoea. To conclude; the results show that it is not unusual to detect stx genes in faecal samples from humans in Norway, both from asymptomatic people and from people with gastrointestinal illness. This finding emphasizes the importance of correct diagnostic criteria for interpretation of the finding of an occasional stx-positive sample or an STEC isolate when searching for an aetiological agent of human cases of diarrhoea.

Reveals new lung adenocarcinoma cancer genes based on gene expression	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Lung adenocarcinoma; Meta-analysis; EGF-like domain; Pathway	IDENTIFICATION; CARCINOMA; RECEPTOR; CELLS; MICROARRAY; INVASION; PATHWAY	BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 30-35% of all cases. AIM: In this study we aim to predict potential genes and confirm pathways which are associated with LAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using the meta-analysis method, GSE10072 and GSE 2514 datasets were merged to find potential genes and pathways which are associated with LAC. RESULTS: Our analysis indicated identified differentially expressed genes enriched in multicellular organismal metabolic process, gland development, and urogenital system development. Further, we predicted genes including EGF-like domain might be the potential target genes for further study, such as NGX6, MUC17, and Nel. In addition, a number of genes that associated with axon guidance, focal adhesion, and complement and coagulation cascades pathway might be also involved in LAC in a direct or indirectly manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicated identified differentially expressed genes enriched in multicellular organismal metabolic process, gland development, and urogenital system development We anticipate numerous advances in LAC research in the coming years based on our meta-analysis.

Since using pure experimental approaches to verify all candidates could be expensive, a number of network-based methods have been developed to prioritize candidates. Such tools usually have a set of parameters pre-trained using available network data. This means that re-training network-based tools may be required when existing biological networks are updated or when networks from different sources are to be tried. Results: We developed a parameter-free method, interconnectedness (ICN), to rank candidate genes by assessing the closeness of them to known disease genes in a network. ICN was tested using 1,993 known disease-gene associations and achieved a success rate of similar to 44% using a protein-protein interaction network under a test scenario of simulated linkage analysis. This performance is comparable with those of other well-known methods and ICN outperforms other methods when a candidate disease gene is not directly linked to known disease genes in a network. Interestingly, we show that a combined scoring strategy could enable ICN to achieve an even better performance (similar to 50%) than other methods used alone. Conclusions: ICN, a user-friendly method, can well complement other network-based methods in the context of prioritizing candidate disease genes.

Gene therapy offers the potential for benefit. Sources of data: Pubmed and clinicaltrials. gov. Areas of agreement: Gene therapy can improve vision in RPE65-associated Leber Congenital Amaurosis (RPE65-LCA). Potential benefit depends on efficient gene transfer and is limited by the extent of retinal degeneration. Areas of controversy: The magnitude of vision improvement from RPE65LCA gene therapy is suboptimal, and its durability may be limited by progressive retinal degeneration. Growing points: The safety and potential benefit of gene therapy for inherited and acquired retinal diseases is being explored in a rapidly expanding number of trials. Areas timely for developing research: Developments in vector design and delivery will enable greater efficiency and safety of gene transfer. Optimization of trial design will accelerate reliable assessment of outcomes.

These proteins are involved in a variety of functions, most notably redox homeostasis. Selenoprotein enzymes with known functions are designated according to these functions: TXNRD1, TXNRD2, and TXNRD3 (thioredoxin reductases), GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, and GPX6 (glutathione peroxidases), DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 (iodothyronine deiodinases), MSRB1 (methionine sulfoxide reductase B1), and SEPHS2 (selenophosphate synthetase 2). Selenoproteins without known functions have traditionally been denoted by SEL or SEP symbols. However, these symbols are sometimes ambiguous and conflict with the approved nomenclature for several other genes. Therefore, there is a need to implement a rational and coherent nomenclature system for selenoprotein-encoding genes. Our solution is to use the root symbol SELENO followed by a letter. This nomenclature applies to SELENOF (selenoprotein F, the 15-kDa selenoprotein, SEP15), SELENOH (selenoprotein H, SELH, C11orf31), SELENOI (selenoprotein I, SELI, EPT1), SELENOK (selenoprotein K, SELK), SELENOM (selenoprotein M, SELM), SELENON (selenoprotein N, SEPN1, SELN), SELENOO (selenoprotein O, SELO), SELENOP (selenoprotein P, SeP, SEPP1, SELP), SELENOS (selenoprotein S, SELS, SEPS1, VIMP), SELENOT (selenoprotein T, SELT), SELENOV (selenoprotein V, SELV), and SELENOW (selenoprotein W, SELW, SEPW1). This system, approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, also resolves conflicting, missing, and ambiguous designations for selenoprotein genes and is applicable to selenoproteins across vertebrates.

The practical utility of finding susceptibility genes with a very small effect is questioned. The empirical findings and implications of developmental perturbations, epigenetics, gene-environment correlations and interactions are then discussed. It is noted that the genes involved in gene-environment interactions may be concerned with susceptibility to all environments and not just adverse ones.

The fibrinogen genes (FGB-FGA-FGG) are expressed almost exclusively in hepatocytes where their output is coordinated to ensure a sufficient mRNA pool for each chain and maintain an abundant plasma fibrinogen protein level. Fibrinogen gene expression is controlled by the activity of proximal promoters which contain binding sites for hepatocyte transcription factors, including proteins which influence fibrinogen transcription in response to acute-phase inflammatory stimuli. The fibrinogen gene cluster also contains cis regulatory elements; enhancer sequences with liver activities identified by sequence conservation and functional genomics. While the transcriptional control of this gene cluster is fascinating biology, the medical impetus to understand fibrinogen gene regulation stems from the association of cardiovascular disease risk with high level circulating fibrinogen. In the general population this level varies from about 1.5 to 3.5 g/l. This variation between individuals is influenced by genotype, suggesting there are genetic variants contributing to fibrinogen levels which reside in fibrinogen regulatory loci. A complete picture of how fibrinogen genes are regulated will therefore point towards novel sources of regulatory variants. In this review we discuss regulation of the fibrinogen genes from proximal promoters and enhancers, the influence of acute-phase simulation, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and functional regulatory variants identified in genetic studies. Finally, we discuss the fibrinogen locus in light of recent advances in understanding chromosomal architecture and suggest future directions for researching the mechanisms that control fibrinogen expression.

Genes conferring resistance to the Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae) and the small brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) have been cloned in rice (Oryza sativa). Mutations in insect avirulence genes that defeat plant resistance have been identified and cloned. Results are consistent with both the gene-for-gene hypothesis and the new model of plant immunity. Insect resistance genes encode proteins with nucleotide binding sites and leucine-rich repeats. Insects use effectors that elicit effector-triggered immunity. At least seven-percent of Hessian fly genes are effector encoding.

Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies: Looking ahead, toward gene correction	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Primary immunodeficiencies; severe combined immunodeficiency; gene therapy; gene correction; locus-specific targeting; homing endonucleases; meganucleases; zinc finger nucleases; safe harbors; transposons	ACTIVATION; PROSPECTS	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for severe primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). For patients lacking an HLA-identical donor, gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option. Approaches based on insertion of a functional gene by using viral vectors have provided proof of concept for the ability of gene therapy to cure PIDs. However, leukemic transformation as a result of insertional mutagenesis has been observed, prompting development of novel approaches based on introduction of DNA double-strand breaks into the endogenous locus to achieve gene correction, or into a safe genomic location ("safe harbor"). Homing endonucleases and zinc finger nucleases are target-specific endonucleases that induce site-specific DNA double-strand breaks, facilitating homologous recombination around their target sites to achieve gene correction or gene insertion into safe harbors. An alternative approach to achieve site-specific insertion of functional genes is based on transposons, DNA elements that spontaneously translocate from a specific chromosomal location to another. These novel tools may lead to efficient and safer strategies to achieve gene therapy for PIDs and other disorders. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:1344-50.)

J	Fischetto, G; Bermon, S				Fischetto, Giuseppe; Bermon, Stephane			From Gene Engineering to Gene Modulation and Manipulation: Can We Prevent or Detect Gene Doping in Sports?	SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review							SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY; SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH; PPAR-DELTA AGONISTS; GROWTH-FACTOR; RECOMBINANT ERYTHROPOIETIN; INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION; MYOSTATIN INHIBITION; MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY; AUTOIMMUNE ANEMIA; THERAPY PROGRESS	During the last 2 decades, progress in deciphering the human gene map as well as the discovery of specific defective genes encoding particular proteins in some serious human diseases have resulted in attempts to treat sick patients with gene therapy. There has been considerable focus on human recombinant proteins which were gene-engineered and produced in vitro (insulin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, erythropoietin). Unfortunately, these substances and methods also became improper tools for unscrupulous athletes. Biomedical research has focused on the possible direct insertion of gene material into the body, in order to replace some defective genes in vivo and/or to promote long-lasting endogenous synthesis of deficient proteins. Theoretically, diabetes, anaemia, muscular dystrophies, immune deficiency, cardiovascular diseases and numerous other illnesses could benefit from such innovative biomedical research, though much work remains to be done. Considering recent findings linking specific genotypes and physical performance, it is tempting to submit the young athletic population to genetic screening or, alternatively, to artificial gene expression modulation. Much research is already being conducted in order to achieve a safe transfer of genetic material to humans. This is of critical importance since uncontrolled production of the specifically coded protein, with serious secondary adverse effects (polycythaemia, acute cardiovascular problems, cancer, etc.), could occur. Other unpredictable reactions (immunogenicity of vectors or DNA-vector complex, autoimmune anaemia, production of wild genetic material) also remain possible at the individual level. Some new substances (myostatin blockers or anti-myostatin antibodies), although not gene material, might represent a useful and well-tolerated treatment to prevent progression of muscular dystrophies. Similarly, other molecules, in the roles of gene or metabolic activators [5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), GW1516], might concomitantly improve endurance exercise capacity in ischaemic conditions but also in normal conditions. Undoubtedly, some athletes will attempt to take advantage of these new molecules to increase strength or endurance. Antidoping laboratories are improving detection methods. These are based both on direct identification of new substances or their metabolites and on indirect evaluation of changes in gene, protein or metabolite patterns (genomics, proteomics or metabolomics).

The usual diagnostic method of oral squamous cell carcinoma is still very primitive by visually examining the mouth. When patients have a definitive diagnosis, they usually have missed the optimal therapeutic period. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose OSCC as early as possible. Microarray technology has been widely used for biomarker identification, but individual gene biomarkers excavated from microarray studies are often limited by poor reproducibility and robustness, since there was little or no overlap between different studies in term of their results. Here, we used both gene based approach and gene set based approach to identify biomarkers of oral squamous cell carcinoma using five independent data sets. Then, we evaluated the reproducibility of differentially expressed genes in five data sets quantified by t-test p values, and the reproducibility of Gene Ontology (GO) gene sets in five data sets, quantified by Matthews's correlation coefficient (MCC) using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). Very weak correlation was found between the differentially expressed genes in most data set pairs - the average Pearson correlation coefficient of ten data set pairs was merely 0.048. However, the GO gene sets among data set pairs are significantly correlated - Pearson correlation test p value is 0 for all data set pairs and the average Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.510. Our study shows that it is feasible to identify stable and reproducible gene set biomarkers and pave a way for discovering diagnostic biomarkers of oral squamous cell carcinoma using GO gene sets.

Exposure to stress is one of the factors that strongly contribute to suicide attempts. The biological response to stress involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Therefore, we found it interesting to study polymorphisms of genes involved in the HPA axis (CRHR1, NR3C1, and AVPBR1). The study was performed on 597 patients, 225 of whom had a history of suicide attempts. We did not observe any significant differences in the studied polymorphisms between the group of patients with a history of suicide attempts and the control subjects. Our haplotype analysis of the AVPR1b gene revealed an association between the GCA haplotype and suicide attempts; however, this association was not significant after correcting for multiple testing. We did not observe any other association in haplotype and MDR analysis. We report here a comprehensive analysis of the HPA axis genes and a lack of association for genetic variations regarding the risk of suicide attempts in affective disorder patients. Nonetheless, the inconsistencies with the previously published results indicate the importance of the further investigation of these polymorphisms with respect to the risk of suicide attempts.

In multicellular organism, stimulus-regulated gene transcription is the basis for communication with the environment allowing individual cells to respond to stimuli such as nutrients, chemical stressors and signaling molecules released by other cells of the organism. Hormones, cytokines, and mitogens bind to receptors and ion channels and induce intracellular signaling cascades involving second messengers, kinases, phosphatases, and changes in the concentration of particular ions. Ultimately, the signaling cascades reach the nucleus. Transcription factors are activated that respond to cellular stimulation and induce changes in gene transcription. Investigating stimulus-transcription coupling combines cell biology with genetics. In this review, we discuss the molecular biology of stimulus-induced transcriptional activators and their responsiveness to extracellular and intracellular signaling molecules and to epigenetic regulators. Stimulus-induced gene expression is measured by several methods, including detection of nuclear translocation of transcription factors, phosphorylation or DNA binding. In this article, we emphasize that the most reliable method to directly measure transcriptional activation involves the use of chromatin-embedded reporter genes.

In addition, baculovirus has been successfully applied for foreign gene delivery into mammalian cells without any viral replication. However, several CpG motifs are present throughout baculoviral DNA and induce an antiviral response in mammalian cells, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon through a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent or -independent signaling pathway, and ultimately limiting the efficiency of transgene expression. On the other hand, by taking advantage of this strong adjuvant activity, recombinant baculoviruses encoding neutralization epitopes can elicit protective immunity in mice. Moreover, immunodeficient cells, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)- or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cells, are more susceptible to baculovirus infection than normal cells and are selectively eliminated by the apoptosis-inducible recombinant baculovirus. Here, we summarize the application of baculovirus as a gene expression vector and the mechanism of the host innate immune response induced by baculovirus in mammalian cells. We also discuss the future prospects of baculovirus vectors.

Gene Expression in Leishmania Is Regulated Predominantly by Gene Dosage	MBIO			English	Article						CNV; Leishmania; RNA-seq; gene dosage; gene expression	DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; ADENYLATE CYCLASES; TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI; MESSENGER-RNAS; POPULATION; CHROMOSOME; GENOME; MODULATION; ANEUPLOIDY; STRAINS	Leishmania tropica, a unicellular eukaryotic parasite present in North and East Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent, has been linked to large outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis in displaced populations in Iraq, Jordan, and Syria. Here, we report the genome sequence of this pathogen and 7,863 identified protein-coding genes, and we show that the majority of clinical isolates possess high levels of allelic diversity, genetic admixture, heterozygosity, and extensive aneuploidy. By utilizing paired genome-wide high-throughput DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) with RNA-seq, we found that gene dosage, at the level of individual genes or chromosomal "somy" (a general term covering disomy, trisomy, tetrasomy, etc.), accounted for greater than 85% of total gene expression variation in genes with a 2-fold or greater change in expression. High gene copy number variation (CNV) among membrane-bound transporters, a class of proteins previously implicated in drug resistance, was found for the most highly differentially expressed genes. Our results suggest that gene dosage is an adaptive trait that confers phenotypic plasticity among natural Leishmania populations by rapid down-or upregulation of transporter proteins to limit the effects of environmental stresses, such as drug selection. IMPORTANCE Leishmania is a genus of unicellular eukaryotic parasites that is responsible for a spectrum of human diseases that range from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) to life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Developmental and strain-specific gene expression is largely thought to be due to mRNA message stability or posttranscriptional regulatory networks for this species, whose genome is organized into polycistronic gene clusters in the absence of promoter-mediated regulation of transcription initiation of nuclear genes. Genetic hybridization has been demonstrated to yield dramatic structural genomic variation, but whether such changes in gene dosage impact gene expression has not been formally investigated. Here we show that the predominant mechanism determining transcript abundance differences (>85%) in Leishmania tropica is that of gene dosage at the level of individual genes or chromosomal somy.

Gene expression studies of ALS only rarely identify the same gene pathways as gene association studies. We hypothesized that analyzing tissues by matching on degree of disease severity would identify different patterns of gene expression from a traditional case-control comparison. We analyzed gene expression changes in 4 postmortem central nervous system regions, stratified by severity of motor neuron loss. An overall comparison of cases (n = 6) and controls (n = 3) identified known ALS gene, SOX5, as showing differential expression (log2 fold change = 0.09, p = 5.5 x 10(-5)). Analyses stratified by disease severity identified expression changes in C9orf72 (p = 2.77 x 10(-3)), MATR3 (p = 3.46 x 10(-3)), and VEGFA (p = 8.21 x 10(-4)), all implicated in ALS through genetic studies, and changes in other genes in pathways involving RNA processing and immune response. These findings suggest that analysis of gene expression stratified by disease severity can identify major ALS genes and may be more efficient than traditional case-control comparison.

J	Sirbu, A; Ruskin, HJ; Crane, M				Sirbu, Alina; Ruskin, Heather J.; Crane, Martin			Integrating heterogeneous gene expression data for gene regulatory network modelling	THEORY IN BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Gene expression; Wavelets; Data integration; Genetic regulatory networks; Complex systems; Mathematical modelling	NORMALIZATION; TRANSCRIPTION; PHASE; GAP	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex biological systems that have a large impact on protein levels, so that discovering network interactions is a major objective of systems biology. Quantitative GRN models have been inferred, to date, from time series measurements of gene expression, but at small scale, and with limited application to real data. Time series experiments are typically short (number of time points of the order of ten), whereas regulatory networks can be very large (containing hundreds of genes). This creates an under-determination problem, which negatively influences the results of any inferential algorithm. Presented here is an integrative approach to model inference, which has not been previously discussed to the authors' knowledge. Multiple heterogeneous expression time series are used to infer the same model, and results are shown to be more robust to noise and parameter perturbation. Additionally, a wavelet analysis shows that these models display limited noise over-fitting within the individual datasets.

Automated construction and testing of multi-locus gene-gene associations	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							LINKAGE-DISEQUILIBRIUM; UNLINKED LOCI; HAPLOTYPES; EPISTASIS; DISEASES	Summary: It has been argued that the missing heritability in common diseases may be in part due to rare variants and gene-gene effects. Haplotype analyses provide more power for rare variants and joint analyses across genes can address multi-gene effects. Currently, methods are lacking to perform joint multi-locus association analyses across more than one gene/region. Here, we present a haplotypemining gene-gene analysis method, which considers multi-locus data for two genes/regions simultaneously. This approach extends our single region haplotype-mining algorithm, hapConstructor, to two genes/regions. It allows construction of multi-locus SNP sets at both genes and tests joint gene-gene effects and interactions between single variants or haplotype combinations. A Monte Carlo framework is used to provide statistical significance assessment of the joint and interaction statistics, thus the method can also be used with related individuals. This tool provides a flexible data-mining approach to identifying gene-gene effects that otherwise is currently unavailable.

In recent years, several whole genome and candidate gene association studies have been published reporting MAP susceptibility genes, but the putative interaction between them remains unknown. Here, twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms in the bovine SLC11A1, NOD2, SP110, TLR2, TLR4, and CD209 genes, previously related with paratuberculosis disease, have been analyzed. Several significant (P < 0.05) pair-wise genetic interactions were detected: CD209-TLR4, CD209-TLR2, TLR4-TLR2, SP110-SLC11A1, SP110-TLR2, and SP110-NOD2. The statistical interaction described here between bovine CD209 and TLR4 genes may be indicative of the biological interaction between their protein products upon infection by mycobacteria, as has been reported to occur in humans. Overall, this is the first evidence of epistasis among bovine innate immunity genes affecting susceptibility to MAP infection, corroborating, in turn, their implication in the disease.

J	Du, L				Du, Li			Patenting human genes: Chinese academic articles' portrayal of gene patents	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Human gene patents; Chinese scholars; Patentability	CONTROVERSY; PROTECTION; MYRIAD	Background: The patenting of human genes has been the subject of debate for decades. While China has gradually come to play an important role in the global genomics-based testing and treatment market, little is known about Chinese scholars' perspectives on patent protection for human genes. Methods: A content analysis of academic literature was conducted to identify Chinese scholars' concerns regarding gene patents, including benefits and risks of patenting human genes, attitudes that researchers hold towards gene patenting, and any legal and policy recommendations offered for the gene patent regime in China. Results: 57.2% of articles were written by law professors, but scholars from health sciences, liberal arts, and ethics also participated in discussions on gene patent issues. While discussions of benefits and risks were relatively balanced in the articles, 63.5% of the articles favored gene patenting in general and, of the articles (n = 41) that explored gene patents in the Chinese context, 90.2% supported patent protections for human genes in China. The patentability of human genes was discussed in 33 articles, and 75.8% of these articles reached the conclusion that human genes are patentable. Conclusion: Chinese scholars view the patent regime as an important legal tool to protect the interests of inventors and inventions as well as the genetic resources of China. As such, many scholars support a gene patent system in China. These attitudes towards gene patents remain unchanged following the court ruling in the Myriad case in 2013, but arguments have been raised about the scope of gene patents, in particular that the increasing numbers of gene patents may negatively impact public health in China.

Reference genes for gene expression studies in the mouse heart	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE PCR DATA; REAL-TIME PCR; SELECTION; FAILURE; EMBRYOS; LINE	To be accurate, quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) studies require a set of stable reference genes for normalization. This is especially critical in cardiac research because of the diversity of the clinical and experimental conditions in the field. We analyzed the stability of previously described as potential reference genes in different subsets of cardiac tissues, each representing a different field in cardiac research. The qPCR dataset was based on 119 different tissue samples derived from cardiac development to pathology in mouse adult hearts. These samples were grouped into 47 tissue types. The stability of 9 candidate genes was analyzed in each of 12 experimental conditions comprising different groupings of these tissue types. Expression stability was determined with the geNorm module of qbase+. This analysis showed that different sets of two or three reference genes are required for analysis of qPCR data in different experimental conditions in murine cardiac research.

CHARGE Nutr Study Grp	Gene-Environment Interactions of Circadian-Related Genes for Cardiometabolic Traits	DIABETES CARE			English	Article							FASTING PLASMA-GLUCOSE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; SLEEP DURATION; VARIANTS; OBESITY; CLOCK; ASSOCIATION; MTNR1B; LOCI; POLYMORPHISMS	OBJECTIVE Common circadian-related gene variants associate with increased risk for metabolic alterations including type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about whether diet and sleep could modify associations between circadian-related variants (CLOCK-rs1801260, CRY2-rs11605924, MTNR1B-rs1387153, MTNR1B-rs10830963, NR1D1-rs2314339) and cardiometabolic traits (fasting glucose [FG], HOMA-insulin resistance, BMI, waist circumference, and HDL-cholesterol) to facilitate personalized recommendations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted inverse-variance weighted, fixed-effect meta-analyses of results of adjusted associations and interactions between dietary intake/sleep duration and selected variants on cardiometabolic traits from 15 cohort studies including up to 28,190 participants of European descent from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. RESULTS We observed significant associations between relative macronutrient intakes and glycemic traits and short sleep duration (<7 h) and higher FG and replicated known MTNR1B associations with glycemic traits. No interactions were evident after accounting for multiple comparisons. However, we observed nominally significant interactions (all P < 0.01) between carbohydrate intake and MTNR1B-rs1387153 for FG with a 0.003 mmol/L higher FG with each additional 1% carbohydrate intake in the presence of the T allele, between sleep duration and CRY2-rs11605924 for HDL-cholesterol with a 0.010 mmol/L higher HDL-cholesterol with each additional hour of sleep in the presence of the A allele, and between long sleep duration (>= 9 h) and MTNR1B-rs1387153 for BMI with a 0.60 kg/m(2) higher BMI with long sleep duration in the presence of the T allele relative to normal sleep duration (>= 7 to < 9 h). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that lower carbohydrate intake and normal sleep duration may ameliorate cardiometabolic abnormalities conferred by common circadian-related genetic variants. Until further mechanistic examination of the nominally significant interactions is conducted, recommendations applicable to the general population regarding diet-specifically higher carbohydrate and lower fat composition-and normal sleep duration should continue to be emphasized among individuals with the investigated circadian-related gene variants.

Computational methods that integrate complex, heterogeneous data sets - such as expression data, sequence information, functional annotation and the biomedical literature - allow prioritizing genes for future study in a more informed way. Such methods can substantially increase the yield of downstream studies and are becoming invaluable to researchers.

Main methods: This study included 198 patients with T2DM and 255 healthy individuals. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses were used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Logistic regression and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) methods were used to analyze gene-gene interactions. Key findings: The frequency distribution of adiponectin SNP11377 was not different (p = 0.792), but the frequency of CC, CG and GG genotypes showed the difference between two groups (T2DM: 57.1%, 33.3%, and 9.6%; control: 53.7%, 41.6%, and 4.7%, respectively; p = 0.047). Adiponectin SNP45, SNP276 and PPAR gamma SNPp12a were equally distributed between the two groups (p = 0.586, 0.119, 0.437, respectively), and there were no significant differences in genotype frequencies between the two groups (p = 0.751, 0.144, 0.479, respectively). Linkage disequilibrium existed between SNP11377 and SNP45 (p < 0.001) and SNP45 and SNP276 (p < 0.001). Haplotype analyses showed no significant differences between the T2DM and control groups. According to the logistic regression and MDR gene-gene interaction analyses. SNP11377GG and SNP276GT interactions increased the risk of T2DM (odds ratio = 6.984, p = 0.012). Significance: Adiponectin SNP11377 and SNP276 gene-gene interactions are associated with the increased risk of T2DM in this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Daley, J				Daley, Jim			Gene Therapy Arrives	SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN			English	Article								The idea for gene therapy-a type of DNA-based medicine that inserts a healthy gene into cells to replace a mutated, diseasecausing variant-was first published in 1972. After decades of disputed results, treatment failures and some deaths in experimental trials, the first gene therapy drug, for a type of skin cancer, was approved in China in 2003. The rest of the world was not easily convinced of the benefits, however, and it was not until 2017 that the U.S. approved one of these medicines. Since then, the pace of approvals has accelerated quickly. At least nine gene therapies have been approved for certain kinds of cancer, some viral infections and a few inherited disorders. A related drug type interferes with faulty genes by using stretches of DNA or RNA to hinder their workings. After nearly half a century, the concept of genetic medicine has become a reality. GENE INSERTION These treatments use a harmless virus to carry a good gene into cells, where the virus inserts it into the existing genome, canceling the effects of harmful mutations in another gene.										0	0	0	2	7	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES	0036-8733	1946-7087		SCI AM	Sci.Am.

J	Nitzan, M; Karaiskos, N; Friedman, N; Rajewsky, N				Nitzan, Mor; Karaiskos, Nikos; Friedman, Nir; Rajewsky, Nikolaus			Gene expression cartography	NATURE			English	Article							SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION; SEQ; TECHNOLOGY	Multiplexed RNA sequencing in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences(1-4). Often, however, tissues must first be dissociated, and crucial information about spatial relationships and communication between cells is thus lost. Existing approaches to reconstruct tissues assign spatial positions to each cell, independently of other cells, by using spatial patterns of expression of marker genes(5,6)-which often do not exist. Here we reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional profiles that are often (but not always) more similar than cells that are farther apart. We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. We reconstruct the spatial expression of genes in mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium, fly and zebrafish embryos, sections from the mammalian cerebellum and whole kidney, and use the reconstructed tissues to identify genes that are spatially informative. Thus, we identify an organization principle for the spatial expression of genes in animal tissues, which can be exploited to infer meaningful probabilities of spatial position for individual cells. Our framework ('novoSpaRc') can incorporate prior spatial information and is compatible with any single-cell technology. Additional principles that underlie the cartography of gene expression can be tested using our approach.

There are mechanisms that ensure the right level of gene expression in the different cell types: the formation of protein molecules based on the DNA-encoded genetic information. Gene expression can also be regulated through the compactness of chromatin, i.e. the accessibility of the genes. The chromosomes are repositories of the genetic information - the sequence of base pairs - and also of the so-called epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression through the regulation of chromatin compactness. The epigenetic mechanisms operate through DNA methylation and/or the regulation of chromatin compactness. The present overview takes a look into the phenomenon of epigenesis. It summarizes how genetic crosses reveal the involvement of epigenesis, explains its meaning and impact on life of the organisms. An understanding of epigenesis provides guidance to improve our life.

Despite its conservation from fish to mammals, expression of otospiralin was only investigated in mammals. Here, we report for the first time the expression profile of OTOS orthologous genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio): otospiralin and si:ch73-23l24.1 (designated otospiralin-like). In situ hybridization analyses in zebrafish embryos showed a specific expression of otospiralin-like in notochord (from 14 to 48 hpf) and similar expression patterns for otospiralin and otospiralin-like in gut (from 72 to 120 hpf), swim bladder (from 96 to 120 hpf) and inner ear (at 120 hpf). Morpholino knockdown of otospiralin and otospiralin-like showed no strong change of the body structure of the embryos at 5 dpf and the inner ear was normally formed. Nevertheless, knockdown embryos showed a reduced number of kinocilia in the lateral crista, indicating that these genes play an important role in kinocilium formation. RT-qPCR revealed that otospiralin is highly expressed in adult zebrafish inner ear comparing to the others analyzed tissues as previously shown for mice. Interestingly, otospiralin-like was not detected in the inner ear which suggests that otospiralin have a more important function in hearing than otospiralin-like. Phylogenetic analysis of otospiralin proteins in vertebrates indicated the presence of two subgroups and supported the functional divergence observed in zebrafish for otospiralin and otospiralin-like genes. This study offers the first insight into the expression of otospiralin and otospiralin-like in zebrafish. Expression data point to an important role for otospiralin in zebrafish hearing and a specific role for otospiralin-like in notochord vacuolization.

J	Wang, JY; Yao, WX; Wang, Y; Fan, YL; Wu, JB				Wang, Ji-Ye; Yao, Wei-Xuan; Wang, Yun; Fan, Yi-lei; Wu, Jian-Bing			Network analysis reveals crosstalk between autophagy genes and disease genes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN INTERACTION NETWORK; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CANCER-CELLS; P53 STATUS; RESOURCE; STRESS; SYSTEM; ORGANIZATION; ACTIVATION; MODULARITY	Autophagy is a protective and life-sustaining process in which cytoplasmic components are packaged into double-membrane vesicles and targeted to lysosomes for degradation. Accumulating evidence supports that autophagy is associated with several pathological conditions. However, research on the functional cross-links between autophagy and disease genes remains in its early stages. In this study, we constructed a disease-autophagy network (DAN) by integrating known disease genes, known autophagy genes and protein-protein interactions (PPI). Dissecting the topological properties of the DAN suggested that nodes that both autophagy and disease genes (inter-genes), are topologically important in the DAN structure. Next, a core network from the DAN was extracted to analyze the functional links between disease and autophagy genes. The genes in the core network were significantly enriched in multiple disease-related pathways, suggesting that autophagy genes may function in various disease processes. Of 17 disease classes, 11 significantly overlapped with autophagy genes, including cancer diseases, metabolic diseases and hematological diseases, a finding that is supported by the literatures. We also found that autophagy genes have a bridging role in the connections between pairs of disease classes. Altogether, our study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases and the autophagy process.

Based on the premise there is a hidden, but plausible, relationship between an entity in one article and an entity in its citing article, we constructed a GCG network of gene pairs implicitly connected through citation. We compare the performance of this GCG network to a gene-gene (GG) network constructed over the same corpus but which uses gene pairs explicitly connected through traditional co-occurrence. Using 331,411 MEDLINE abstracts collected from 18,323 seed articles and their references, we identify 25 gene pairs. A comparison of these pairs with interactions found in BioGRID reveal that 96% of the gene pairs in the GCG network have known interactions. We measure network performance using degree, weighted degree, closeness, betweenness centrality and PageRank. Combining all measures, we find the GCG network has more gene pairs, but a lower matching rate than the GG network. However, combining top ranked genes in both networks produces a matching rate of 35.53%. By visualizing both the GG and GCG networks, we find that cancer is the most dominant disease associated with the genes in both networks. Overall, the study indicates that the GCG network can be useful for detecting gene interaction in an implicit manner.

It is closely related to CD4 where it shares multiple common and divergent features. It contains specific binding sites with high affinity to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II and functions as an inhibitor of T-cell signalling. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes with high LAG-3 expression have been found in many solid tumours including ovarian cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer and haematological malignancies including Hodgkin and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. LAG-3 antagonism has been demonstrated to restore the anti-tumourigenic function of T-cells in vivo, however, mechanistic knowledge remains relatively poorly defined. As other immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the management of difficult to treat cancers, such as melanoma, it is hoped that LAG-3 might have the same potential. This review will explore LAG-3 modulation as an anticancer therapy, highlighting recent clinical developments.

GO annotations associate genes with GO terms and indicate the given gene products carrying out the biological functions described by the relevant terms. However, predicting correct GO annotations for genes from a massive set of GO terms as defined by GO is a difficult challenge. To combat with this challenge, we introduce a Gene Ontology Hierarchy Preserving Hashing (HPHash) based semantic method for gene function prediction. HPHash firstly measures the taxonomic similarity between GO terms. It then uses a hierarchy preserving hashing technique to keep the hierarchical order between GO terms, and to optimize a series of hashing functions to encode massive GO terms via compact binary codes. After that, HPHash utilizes these hashing functions to project the gene-term association matrix into a low-dimensional one and performs semantic similarity based gene function prediction in the low-dimensional space. Experimental results on three model species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus) for interspecies gene function prediction show that HPHash performs better than other related approaches and it is robust to the number of hash functions. In addition, we also take HPHash as a plugin for BLAST based gene function prediction. From the experimental results, HPHash again significantly improves the prediction performance. The codes of HPHash are available at:http://mlda.swu.edu.cn/codes.php?name=HPHash.

The gene expression data provided by microarray technology is of enormous size i.e. high dimensional which makes the downstream analysis a very challenging task. The gene selection is an essential process which removes the problem of dimensionality by removing irrelevant and unwanted genes from gene expression data. A variety of gene selection techniques are available in the literature which are used widely to find the most informative and significant genes from the given gene expression dataset. This paper reviews different aspects of gene selection and other research issues which came across while analyzing gene expression data. The article provides a brief overview of the gene selection for high dimensionality reduction in gene expression data.

Despite significant progresses in the last several years, the accuracy of gene function prediction still needs to be improved in order to be used effectively in practice. Two of the main issues of AFP problem are the imbalance of gene functional annotations and the 'multifunctional properties' of genes. While the former is a well studied problem in machine learning, the latter has recently emerged in bioinformatics and few studies have been carried out about it. Here we propose a method for AFP which appropriately handles the label imbalance characterizing biological taxonomies, and embeds in the model the property of some genes of being 'multifunctional'. We tested the method in predicting the functions of the Gene Ontology functional hierarchy for genes of yeast and fly model organisms, in a genome-wide approach. The achieved results show that cost-sensitive strategies and 'gene multifunctionality' can be combined to achieve significantly better results than the compared state-of-the-art algorithms for AFP.

This review covers the entire life cycle of such de novo genes. Two competing hypotheses about the process of de novo gene birth are discussed as well as the high death rate of de novo genes. Despite the high death rate, some de novo genes are retained and remain functional, even in distantly related species, through their integration into gene networks. Further studies combining gene expression with ribosome profiling in multiple populations across different species will be instrumental for an improved understanding of the evolutionary processes operating on de novo genes.

The multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method is one of the most commonly used methods for identifying gene-gene interactions with dichotomous phenotypes. For quantitative phenotypes, the generalized MDR or quantitative MDR (QMDR) methods have been proposed. These methods are known as univariate methods because they consider only one phenotype. To date, there are few methods for analyzing multiple phenotypes. Methods: To address this problem, we propose a multivariate QMDR method (Multi-QMDR) for multivariate correlated phenotypes. We summarize the multivariate phenotypes into a univariate score by dimensional reduction analysis, and then classify the samples accordingly into highrisk and low-risk groups. We use different ways of summarizing mainly based on the principal components. Multi-QMDR is model-free and easy to implement. Results: Multi-QMDR is applied to lipid-related traits. The properties of Multi-QMDR were investigated through simulation studies. Empirical studies show that Multi-QMDR outperforms existing univariate and multivariate methods at identifying causal interactions. Conclusions: The Multi-QMDR approach improves the performance of QMDR when multiple quantitative phenotypes are available. (C) 2015 S.

However, the essential step that determines appropriate and correct data interpretation is the selection of proper endogenous control genes. Identifying useful reference genes with stable expression is critical for accurate normalization and precise results. Functional divergence of duplicated genes in tetraploid species, like common carp, can complicate the choice for a proper reference gene. In the present study, we determined the expression stability of duplicated genes of 40s, b2m, ef1 alpha, gapdh, g6pd, and odc1 in different tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Gene expression analysis comprised healthy control fish, fish under bacterial and parasitic infections, and across the early stage of common carp development. Obtained data were compared with the actb gene, which is used widely as a reference in RT-qPCR analysis. The application of the three different algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, Best Keeper, allowed comparative evaluation of the expression stability of the tested genes. Subsequently, the Ref Finder, a web-based tool, was used to rank the examined housekeeping genes comprehensively. We demonstrate variable transcription stability levels in the examined mRNAs as well as differences in expression between paralog gene copies. The 40s, b2m, ef1 alpha and actb genes showed the most stable expression across all physiological conditions and tissues. The gapdh, odc1, and g6pd gene variants demonstrated lower stability. Differences in expression patterns between duplicated genes underline the possibility of functional divergence between them. This aspect should be considered in polyploid species before selecting the reference gene(s). Our study also points on the importance of choice for a reference gene (paralog) when expressing newly identified genes and the spatial expression profile is performed.

Since iron and cholesterol accumulation impact on neurodegener-ative disease, the associated gene variants are appealing candidate targets for risk and disease progression assessment. In this light, we explored the role of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the main iron homeostasis genes and in the main lipoprotein transporter gene (APOE) in a cohort of 765 patients with dementia of different origin: Alzheimer's disease (AD) n = 276; vascular dementia (VaD), n = 255; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 234; and in normal controls (n = 1086). In details, four genes of iron homeostasis (Hemochromatosis (HFE: 0282Y, H63D), Ferroportin (FPN1: -8CG), Hepcidin (HAMP. -582AG), Transferrin (TF: P570S)), and the three major alleles of APOE (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4) were analyzed to explore causative interactions and synergies. In single analysis, HFE282Y allele yielded a 3-fold risk reduction in the whole cohort of patients (P<0.0001), confirmed in AD and VaD, reaching a 5-fold risk reduction in MCI (P = 0.0019). The other iron SNPs slightly associated with risk reduction whereas APOE4 allele resulted in increased risk, reaching more than 7-fold increased risk in AD homozygotes (P = 0.001), confirmed to a lower extent in VaD and MCI (P = 0.038 and P = 0.013 respectively) as well as in the whole group (P<0.0001). Comparisons of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) among AD showed appreciable lowering in APOE4 carriers (P = 0.038), confirmed in the whole cohort of patients (P = 0.018).

Metastasis is a complex process that requires the regulation of both metastasis-promoting and metastasis suppressor genes. The discovery of metastasis suppressor genes contributes significantly to our understanding of metastasis mechanisms and provides prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in clinical cancer management. In this review, we summarize the methods that have been used to identify metastasis suppressors and the potential clinical impact of these genes.

Here, we survey the various types of cryptic genes and the corresponding deciphering strategies employed by cells. Encryption that renders genes substantially different from homologs in other species includes sequence substitution, insertion, deletion, fragmentation plus scrambling, and invasion by mobile genetic elements. Cells decode cryptic genes at the DNA, RNA or protein level. We will focus on a recently discovered case of unparalleled encryption involving massive gene fragmentation and nucleotide deletions and substitutions, occurring in the mitochondrial genome of a poorly understood protist group, the diplonemids. This example illustrates that comprehensive gene detection requires not only auxiliary sequence information - transcriptome and proteome data - but also knowledge about a cell's deciphering arsenal.

GSHs are thus ideal sites for transgene insertion whose use can empower functional genetics studies in basic research and therapeutic applications in human gene therapy. Currently, no fully validated GSHs exist in the human genome. Here, we review our formerly proposed GSH criteria and discuss additional considerations on extending these criteria, on strategies for the identification and validation of GSHs, as well as future prospects on GSH targeting for therapeutic applications. In view of recent advances in genome biology, gene targeting technologies, and regenerative medicine, gene insertion into GSHs can potentially catalyze nearly all applications in human gene therapy.

Asthma is caused by a complex interaction between genes and environmental exposures; early-life exposures in particular play an important role. Asthma is also heritable, and a number of susceptibility variants have been discovered in genome-wide association studies, although the known risk alleles explain only a small proportion of the heritability. In this review, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that focusing on more specific asthma phenotypes, such as childhood asthma with severe exacerbations, and on relevant exposures that are involved in gene-environment interactions (GEIs), such as rhinovirus infections, will improve detection of asthma genes and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We will discuss the challenges of considering GEIs and the advantages of studying responses to asthma-associated exposures in clinical birth cohorts, as well as in cell models of GEIs, to dissect the context-specific nature of genotypic risks, to prioritize variants in genome-wide association studies, and to identify pathways involved in pathogenesis in subgroups of patients. We propose that such approaches, in spite of their many challenges, present great opportunities for better understanding of asthma pathogenesis and heterogeneity and, ultimately, for improving prevention and treatment of disease.

The SLEEPER genes: a transposase-derived angiosperm-specific gene family	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS; BINDING PROTEINS; EVOLUTION; RESOURCES; ELEMENTS	Background: DAYSLEEPER encodes a domesticated transposase from the hAT-superfamily, which is essential for development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Little is known about the presence of DAYSLEEPER orthologs in other species, or how and when it was domesticated. We studied the presence of DAYSLEEPER orthologs in plants and propose a model for the domestication of the ancestral DAYSLEEPER gene in angiosperms. Results: Using specific BLAST searches in genomic and EST libraries, we found that DAYSLEEPER-like genes (hereafter called SLEEPER genes) are unique to angiosperms. Basal angiosperms as well as grasses (Poaceae) and dicotyledonous plants possess such putative orthologous genes, but SLEEPER-family genes were not found in gymnosperms, mosses and algae. Most species contain more than one SLEEPER gene. All SLEEPERs contain a C2H2 type BED-zinc finger domain and a hATC dimerization domain. We designated 3 motifs, partly overlapping the BED-zinc finger and dimerization domain, which are hallmark features in the SLEEPER family. Although SLEEPER genes are structurally conserved between species, constructs with SLEEPER genes from grapevine and rice did not complement the daysleeper phenotype in Arabidopsis, when expressed under control of the DAYSLEEPER promoter. However these constructs did cause a dominant phenotype when expressed in Arabidopsis. Rice plant lines with an insertion in the RICESLEEPER1 or 2 locus displayed phenotypic abnormalities, indicating that these genes are functional and important for normal development in rice. We suggest a model in which we hypothesize that an ancestral hAT transposase was retrocopied and stably integrated in the genome during early angiosperm evolution. Evidence is also presented for more recent retroposition events of SLEEPER genes, such as an event in the rice genome, which gave rise to the RICESLEEPER1 and 2 genes. Conclusions: We propose the ancestral SLEEPER gene was formed after a process of retro-transposition during the evolution of the first angiosperms. It may have acquired an important function early on, as mutation of two SLEEPER genes in rice, like the daysleeper mutant in A. thaliana gave a developmental phenotype indicative of their importance for normal plant development.

In this regard, we propose a Bayesian semiparametric model to detect not only the roles of genes and their interactions, but also the possible influence of environmental variables on the genes in case-control studies. Our model also accounts for the unknown number of genetic sub-populations via finite mixtures composed of Dirichlet processes. An effective parallel computing methodology, developed by us harnesses the power of parallel processing technology to increase the efficiencies of our conditionally independent Gibbs sampling and Transformation based MCMC (TMCMC) methods. Applications of our model and methods to simulation studies with biologically realistic genotype datasets and a real, case-control based genotype dataset on early onset of myocardial infarction (MI) have yielded quite interesting results beside providing some insights into the differential effect of gender on MI.

Germline polymorphisms in the Von Hippel-Lindau and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha genes, gene-environment and gene-gene interactions and renal cell cancer	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; METHYLATION-SPECIFIC PCR; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; RISK; CARCINOMA; VHL; MUTATIONS; VARIANTS; COHORT	We investigated the relationship between germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A), and their gene-environment and gene-gene interactions, and clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) risk. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between VHL SNPs and VHL promoter methylation. Three VHL polymorphisms and one HIF1A polymorphism were genotyped in the Netherlands Cohort Study. In 1986, 120,852 participants aged 55-69 completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet and lifestyle and toenail clippings were collected. Toenail DNA was genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. After 20.3 years, 3004 subcohort members and 406 RCC cases, of which 263 ccRCC cases, were eligible for multivariate case-cohort analyses. VHL_rs779805 was associated with RCC (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.07-2.17) and ccRCC risk (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.25-2.81). No associations were found for other SNPs. Potential gene-environment interactions were found between alcohol consumption and selected SNPs. However, none remained statistically significant after multiple comparison correction. No gene-gene interactions were observed between VHL and HIF1A. VHL promoter methylation was not associated with VHL SNPs. VHL SNPs may increase (cc)RCC susceptibility. No associations were found between gene-environment and gene-gene interactions and (cc)RCC risk and between VHL promoter methylation and VHL SNPs.	[van de Pol, Jeroen A.

A misregulated gene can be incorrectly silent ("off") when a transcription factor (TF) that is required for its activation does not binds its regulatory region. Conversely, a misregulated gene can be incorrectly active ("on") when a TF not normally involved in its activation binds its regulatory region, a phenomenon also known as regulatory crosstalk. DNA mutations that destroy or create TF binding sites on DNA are an important source of misregulation and crosstalk. Although misregulation reduces fitness in an environment to which an organism is well-adapted, it may become adaptive in a new environment. Here, I derive simple yet general mathematical expressions that delimit the conditions under which misregulation can be adaptive. These expressions depend on the strength of selection against misregulation, on the fraction of DNA sequence space filled with TF binding sites, and on the fraction of genes that must be expressed for optimal adaptation. I then use empirical data from RNA sequencing, protein-binding microarrays, and genome evolution, together with population genetic simulations to ask when these conditions are likely to be met. I show that they can be met under realistic circumstances, but these circumstances may vary among organisms and environments. My analysis provides a framework in which improved theory and data collection can help us demonstrate the role of misregulation in adaptation. It also shows that misregulation, like DNA mutation, is one of life's many imperfections that can help propel Darwinian evolution.

The ascidian genome contains two Zic genes, called Zic-r. a (also called Macho-1) and Zic-r. b (ZicL). The latter is a multi-copy gene, and the precise copy number has not yet been determined. Zic-r. a is maternally expressed, and soon after fertilization Zic-r. a mRNA is localized in the posterior pole of the zygote. Zic-r. a protein is translated there and is involved in specification of posterior fate; in particular it is important for specification of muscle fate. Zic-r. a is also expressed zygotically in neural cells of the tailbud stage. On the other hand, Zic-r. b is first expressed in marginal cells of the vegetal hemisphere of 32-cell embryos and then in neural cells that contribute to the central nervous system during gastrulation. Zic-r. b is required first for specification of mesodermal tissues and then for specification of the central nervous system. Their upstream and downstream genetic pathways have been studied extensively by functional assays, which include gene knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, ascidian Zic genes play central roles in specification of mesodermal and neural fates.

Genes underlying altruism	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						altruism; inclusive fitness; sociality	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; CASTE DETERMINATION; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; DICTATOR GAME; EVOLUTION; COMPETITION; ALLOCATION	William D. Hamilton postulated the existence of 'genes underlying altruism', under the rubric of inclusive fitness theory, a half-century ago. Such genes are now poised for discovery. In this article, we develop a set of intuitive criteria for the recognition and analysis of genes for altruism and describe the first candidate genes affecting altruism from social insects and humans. We also provide evidence from a human population for genetically based trade-offs, underlain by oxytocin-system polymorphisms, between alleles for altruism and alleles for non-social cognition. Such trade-offs between self-oriented and altruistic behaviour may influence the evolution of phenotypic diversity across all social animals.

In this work, novel GSH-triggered degradable organosilica nanoparticles grafted with guanidinated-fluorinated alpha-polylysine (o-SiNP-GF) are prepared to be studied as gene carriers. The organosilica matrix of o-SiNP-GF is synthesized through the hydrolysis and condensation of 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTSE) and bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]tetrasulfide (BTSPTS). The o-SiNP-GF nanoparticles have a size of about 20 nm. They possess a positive zeta potential of 42 mV in PBS (pH 7.4) and can be disintegrated in the presence of GSH. The cytotoxicity and DNA-binding ability of o-SiNP-GF, as well as in vitro gene transfection performance of DNA/o-SiNP-GF complexes, have been investigated using enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid (pEGFP) as the DNA model. MTT assay shows that the cytotoxicity of o-SiNP-GF is very low even at a concentration up to 800 mu g mL(-1). The o-SiNP-GF nanoparticles can effectively bind to pEGFP through a complex coacervation method. The in vitro transfection efficiency of pEGFP/o-SiNP-GF complexes in 293T cells is up to 94.7% at the N/P ratio of 10, much higher than that of pEGFP/PEI complexes. Luciferase gene and fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) gene are also used as the DNA models to study the in vivo gene transfection performance of the o-SiNP-GF carrier by bioluminescence imaging and the evaluation of the healing rate of a mouse wound, respectively. Compared with naked DNA and DNA/PEI complexes, DNA/o-SiNP-GF complexes show much higher in vivo transfection efficiency. This work not only provides a way to prepare novel GSH-triggered degradable organosilica nanoparticles of size less than 50 nm, but also proves that the modification of guanidinated-fluorinated alpha-polylysine is an effective method to improve the efficiency of gene carriers.

We found a novel APP mutation (A673V) in the homozygous state in a patient with early-onset AD-type dementia and in his younger sister showing initial signs of cognitive decline. It is noteworthy that the heterozygous relatives were not affected, suggesting that this mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Studies on molecular events for the recessive mutation in causing disease revealed a double synergistic effect: the A673V APP variant shifts APP processing towards the amyloidogenic pathway with increased production of A beta peptides and it markedly enhances the aggregation and fibrillogenic properties of both A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42. However, co-incubation of mutated and wild-type (wt) A beta species resulted in inhibition of amyloidogenesis, consistent with the observation that heterozygous carriers do not develop the disease. The opposite effects of the A673V mutation in the homozygous and heterozygous state on amyloidogenesis account for the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, revealing a new scenario in AD genetics and pathogenesis. The anti-amyloidogenic properties of this novel human A beta variant may offer grounds for the development of therapeutic strategies for AD based on modified A beta peptides. Indeed, the interaction between mutated A beta 1-6 and wt full-length A beta prevents amyloid fibril formation. The anti-amyloidogenic effect is further amplified by the use of a mutated six-mer peptide, constructed entirely from D-amino acids to increase the its stability in vivo. Here we reviewed the studies on pathogenic mechanisms associated with the A673V mutation and the first experimental steps toward the development of a novel disease-modifying therapy for AD.

Horizontal gene transfer of stress resistance genes through plasmid transport	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Antimicrobial; Heavy metals; Multiple stress; Conjugation; Transformation	WATERS	The horizontal gene transfer of plasmid-determined stress tolerance was achieved under lab conditions. Bacterial isolates, Enterobacter cloacae (DGE50) and Escherichia coli (DGE57) were used throughout the study. Samples were collected from contaminated marine water and soil to isolate bacterial strains having tolerance against heavy metals and antimicrobial agents. We have demonstrated plasmid transfer, from Amp(+)Cu(+)Zn(-) strain (DGE50) to Amp(-)Cu(-)Zn(+) strain (DGE57), producing Amp(+)Cu(+)Zn(+) transconjugants (DGE(TC50 -> 57)) and Amp(+)Cu(-)Zn(+) transformants (DGE(TF50 -> 57)). DGE57 did not carry any plasmid, therefore, it can be speculated that zinc tolerance gene in DGE57 is located on chromosome. DGE50 was found to carry three plasmids, out of which two were transferred through conjugation into DGE57, and only one was transferred through transformation. Plasmid transferred through transformation was one out of the two transferred through conjugation. Through the results of transformation it was revealed that the genes of copper and ampicillin tolerance in DGE50 were located on separate plasmids, since only ampicillin tolerance genes were transferred through transformation as a result of one plasmid transfer. By showing transfer of plasmids under lab conditions and monitoring retention of respective phenotype via conjugation and transformation, it is very well demonstrated how multiple stress tolerant strains are generated in nature.

Rule based classifier for the analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genetic association studies	BIODATA MINING			English	Article							HARDY-WEINBERG; DISEASE	Background: Several methods have been presented for the analysis of complex interactions between genetic polymorphisms and/or environmental factors. Despite the available methods, there is still a need for alternative methods, because no single method will perform well in all scenarios. The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of three selected rule based classifier algorithms, RIPPER, RIDOR and PART, for the analysis of genetic association studies. Methods: Overall, 42 datasets were simulated with three different case-control models, a varying number of subjects (300, 600), SNPs (500, 1500, 3000) and noise (5%, 10%, 20%). The algorithms were applied to each of the datasets with a set of algorithm-specific settings. Results were further investigated with respect to a) the Model, b) the Rules, and c) the Attribute level. Data analysis was performed using WEKA, SAS and PERL. Results: The RIPPER algorithm discovered the true case-control model at least once in >33% of the datasets. The RIDOR and PART algorithm performed poorly for model detection. The RIPPER, RIDOR and PART algorithm discovered the true case-control rules in more than 83%, 83% and 44% of the datasets, respectively. All three algorithms were able to detect the attributes utilized in the respective case-control models in most datasets. Conclusions: The current analyses substantiate the utility of rule based classifiers such as RIPPER, RIDOR and PART for the detection of gene-gene/gene-environment interactions in genetic association studies. These classifiers could provide a valuable new method, complementing existing approaches, in the analysis of genetic association studies. The methods provide an advantage in being able to handle both categorical and continuous variable types. Further, because the outputs of the analyses are easy to interpret, the rule based classifier approach could quickly generate testable hypotheses for additional evaluation. Since the algorithms are computationally inexpensive, they may serve as valuable tools for preselection of attributes to be used in more complex, computationally intensive approaches. Whether used in isolation or in conjunction with other tools, rule based classifiers are an important addition to the armamentarium of tools available for analyses of complex genetic association studies.

J	Fan, RX; Lo, SH				Fan, Ruixue; Lo, Shaw-Hwa			A Robust Model-free Approach for Rare Variants Association Studies Incorporating Gene-Gene and Gene-Environmental Interactions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; COMPLEX DISEASES; COMMON DISEASES; SUSCEPTIBILITY; STRATEGIES	Recently more and more evidence suggest that rare variants with much lower minor allele frequencies play significant roles in disease etiology. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies will lead to many more rare variants association studies. Several statistical methods have been proposed to assess the effect of rare variants by aggregating information from multiple loci across a genetic region and testing the association between the phenotype and aggregated genotype. One limitation of existing methods is that they only look into the marginal effects of rare variants but do not systematically take into account effects due to interactions among rare variants and between rare variants and environmental factors. In this article, we propose the summation of partition approach (SPA), a robust model-free method that is designed specifically for detecting both marginal effects and effects due to gene-gene (GxG) and gene-environmental (GxE) interactions for rare variants association studies. SPA has three advantages. First, it accounts for the interaction information and gains considerable power in the presence of unknown and complicated GxG or GxE interactions. Secondly, it does not sacrifice the marginal detection power; in the situation when rare variants only have marginal effects it is comparable with the most competitive method in current literature. Thirdly, it is easy to extend and can incorporate more complex interactions; other practitioners and scientists can tailor the procedure to fit their own study friendly. Our simulation studies show that SPA is considerably more powerful than many existing methods in the presence of GxG and GxE interactions.

However, existing approaches may be limited by the sample size in case-control studies. Herein, we propose a balance approach for the multifactor dimensionality reduction (BMDR) method to increase the accuracy of estimates of the prediction error rate in small samples. BMDR explicitly selects the best model by evaluating the average of prediction error rates over k-fold cross-validation without cross-validation consistency selection. In this study, we used several epistatic models with and without marginal effects under different parameter settings (heritability and minor allele frequencies) to evaluate the performance of existing approaches. Using simulated data sets, BMDR successfully detected gene-gene interactions, particularly for data sets with small sample sizes. A large data set was obtained from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, and results indicated that BMDR could effectively detect significant gene-gene interactions.

Many computational approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal; however, there is room for improvement. Recent developments in deep learning techniques can aid in the identification of better prognostic genes and more accurate outcome prediction, but one of the main problems in the adoption of deep learning for this purpose is that data from cancer patients have too many dimensions, while the number of samples is relatively small. In this study, we propose a novel network-based deep learning method to identify prognostic gene signatures via distributed gene representations generated by G2Vec, which is a modified Word2Vec model originally used for natural language processing. We applied the proposed method to five cancer types including liver cancer and showed that G2Vec outperformed extant feature selection methods, especially for small number of samples. Moreover, biomarkers identified by G2Vec was useful to find significant prognostic gene modules associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Reconstructions of gene networks from gene expression data greatly facilitate our understanding of underlying biological mechanisms and provide new opportunities for biomarker and drug discoveries. In gene networks, a gene that has many interactions with other genes is called a hub gene, which usually plays an essential role in gene regulation and biological processes. In this study, we developed a method for reconstructing gene networks using a partial correlation-based approach that incorporates prior information about hub genes. Through simulation studies and two real-data examples, we compare the performance in estimating the network structures between the existing methods and the proposed method. Results: In simulation studies, we show that the proposed strategy reduces errors in estimating network structures compared to the existing methods. When applied to Escherichia coli, the regulation network constructed by our proposed ESPACE method is more consistent with current biological knowledge than the SPACE method. Furthermore, application of the proposed method in lung cancer has identified hub genes whose mRNA expression predicts cancer progress and patient response to treatment. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that incorporating hub gene information in estimating network structures can improve the performance of the existing methods.

J	Kim, Y; Park, T				Kim, Yongkang; Park, Taesung			Robust Gene-Gene Interaction Analysis in Genome Wide Association Studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIFACTOR-DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; EPISTASIS; VARIANTS; INDEX	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully discovered hundreds of associations between genetic variants and complex traits. Most GWAS have focused on the identification of single variants. It has been shown that most of the variants that were discovered by GWAS could only partially explain disease heritability. The explanation for this missing heritability is generally believed to be gene-gene (GG) or gene-environment (GE) interactions and other structural variants. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) has been proven to be reasonably powerful in detecting GG and GE interactions; however, its performance has been found to decline when outlying quantitative traits are present. This paper proposes a robust GMDR estimation method (based on the L-estimator and M-estimator estimation methods) in an attempt to reduce the effects caused by outlying traits. A comparison of robust GMDR with the original MDR based on simulation studies showed the former method to outperform the latter. The performance of robust GMDR is illustrated through a real GWA example consisting of 8,577 samples from the Korean population using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) level as a phenotype. Robust GMDR identified the KCNH1 gene to have strong interaction effects with other genes on the function of insulin secretion.

The gene expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE34095)and included six human IVD samples: three degenerative and three non-degenerative. The DEGs between the normal and disease samples were identified using R packages. The online software WebGestalt was used to perform the functional analysis of the DEGs, followed by Osprey software to search for interactions between the DEGs. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was utilized to annotate the DEGs in the interaction network and then the DEGs were uploaded to the Connectivity Map database to search for small molecules. In addition, the active binding sites for the hub genes in the network were obtained, based on the Universal Protein database. By comparing the gene expression profiles of the non-degenerative and degenerative IVDs, the DEGs between the samples were identified. The DEGs were significantly associated with transforming growth factor beta and the extracellular matrix. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was identified as the hub gene of the interaction network of DEGs. In addition, MMP2 was found to be upregulated in degenerative IVDs. The screened small molecules and the active binding sites of MMP2 may facilitate the development of methods to inhibit overexpression of MMP2.

Fusion Gene Microarray Reveals Cancer Type-Specificity Among Fusion Genes	GENES CHROMOSOMES & CANCER			English	Article							ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; TRANSLOCATION; TUMORS; IDENTIFICATION; CARCINOMA; TPM3-ALK; CLONING; GENOME; ERG	Detection of fusion genes for diagnostic purposes and as a guide to treatment is well-established in hematological malignancies, and the prevalence of fusion genes in epithelial cancers is also increasingly appreciated. To study whether established fusion genes are present within additional cancer types, we have used an updated version of our fusion gene microarray in a systematic survey of reported fusion genes in multiple cancer types. We assembled a comprehensive database of published fusion genes, including those reported only in individual studies and samples, and fusion genes resulting from deep sequencing of cancer genomes and transcriptomes. From the total set of 548 fusion genes, we designed 599,839 oligonucleotides, targeting both chimeric transcript junctions as well as sequences internal to each of the fusion gene partners. We investigated the presence of fusion genes in a series of 67 cell lines representing 15 different cancer types. Data from ten leukemia cell lines with known fusion gene status were used to develop an automated scoring algorithm, and in five cell lines the correct fusion gene was the top scoring hit, and one came second. Two additional fusion genes, BCAS4-BCAS3 in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and CCDC6-RET in the TPC-1 thyroid cancer cell line were validated as true positive fusion transcripts. However, these fusion genes were not new to these cancer types, and none of 548 fusion genes were identified from a novel cancer type. We therefore find it unlikely that the assayed fusion genes are commonly present across multiple cancer types. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	[Lovf, Marthe; Thomassen, Gard O.

Selection of reference genes for gene expression studies in astrocytomas	ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							BETA-ACTIN; GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE; INTERNAL STANDARDS; RNA LEVELS; CLASSIFICATION; PCR	This study was aimed to test a panel of six housekeeping genes (GAPDH, HPRT1, POLR2A, RPLP0, ACTB, and H3F) so as to identify and validate the most suitable reference genes for expression studies in astrocytomas. GAPDH was the most stable and HPRT1 was the least stable reference gene. The effect of reference gene selection on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data interpretation was demonstrated, normalizing the expression data of a selected gene of interest. Thus, GAPDH may be recommended for data normalization in gene expression studies in astrocytomas. Nevertheless, a preliminary validation of reference gene stability is required prior to every study.

Methods: A total of 1106 participants (including 583 males and 523 females) including 550 CAD patients and 556 control subjects were recruited in this study, and the mean age for these participants was 55.5 +/- 11.8 years old. Logistic regression was used to observe association of SNP within PPARG and CYP1A1 with CAD risk and GMDR model was used to screen the best interaction combinations. Results: CAD susceptibility was higher in those with homozygous mutant of rs10865710, rs1805192 and rs4646903 than those with wild-type homozygotes, OR (95% CI) were 1.47 (1.15-1.92), 1.69 (1.27-2.09) and 1.72 (1.35-2.32), respectively. We also found a significant two-locus model involving rs1805192 and rs4646903 (p = 0.0107), and the cross-validation consistency of this locus model was 10 of 10, the testing accuracy of this model is 62.17%. Logistic regression shown that CAD risk was the highest in those with rs1805192-Pro/AlaorAla/Ala and rs4646903-AG+GG genotype, and was lowest in those with rs1805192-Pro/ Pro and rs4646903- AA genotype, OR(95% CI) = 3.56 (1.91-5.42). Conclusions: Polymorphism in rs10865710, rs1805192 and rs4646903 and interaction between rs1805192 and rs4646903 were related with increased CAD susceptibility.

In recent years, our understanding of other mechanisms of gene repression inS.cerevisiaewas significantly advanced. In this review, we focus on such Sir-independent mechanisms of gene repression executed by various Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) and Histone Methyl Transferases (HMTs). We focus on the genes regulated by these enzymes and their known mechanisms of action. We describe the cooperation and redundancy between HDACs and HMTs, and their involvement in gene repression by non-coding RNAs or by their non-histone substrates. We also propose models of epigenetic transmission of the chromatin structures produced by these enzymes and discuss these in the context of gene repression phenomena in other organisms. These include the recycling of the epigenetic marks imposed by HMTs or the recycling of the complexes harboring HDACs.

However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be resolved before this gene delivery vehicle is used in clinical applications, such as the inability of AAV to effectively target specific tissues, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in human populations, and a limited AAV packaging capacity. Over the past two decades, much genetic modification work has been performed with the AAV capsid gene, resulting in a large number of variants with modified characteristics, rendering AAV a versatile vector for more efficient gene therapy applications for different genetic diseases.

Gene Ontology Enrichment Improves Performances of Functional Similarity of Genes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SEMANTIC SIMILARITY; HETESIM; TERMS	There exists a plethora of measures to evaluate functional similarity (FS) between genes, which is a widely used in many bioinformatics applications including detecting molecular pathways, identifying co-expressed genes, predicting protein-protein interactions, and prioritization of disease genes. Measures of FS between genes are mostly derived from Information Contents (IC) of Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotating the genes. However, existing measures evaluating IC of terms based either on the representations of terms in the annotating corpus or on the knowledge embedded in the GO hierarchy do not consider the enrichment of GO terms by the querying pair of genes. The enrichment of a GO term by a pair of gene is dependent on whether the term is annotated by one gene (i.e., partial annotation) or by both genes (i.e. complete annotation) in the pair. In this paper, we propose a method that incorporate enrichment of GO terms by a gene pair in computing their FS and show that GO enrichment improves the performances of 46 existing FS measures in the prediction of sequence homologies, gene expression correlations, protein-protein interactions, and disease associated genes.

CF is an autosomal recessive disease that is due to mutations occurring in the gene encoding for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). Thanks to an early screening and a better care in therapies designed to address the symptoms of the disease, the prognostic has been strongly improved. However, CF remains a severe disease associated with premature death. Recent advances in the pharmacological field led to significant improvements in lung function and normalization of sweat chloride in some CF patients. Concerning gene therapy, numerous non-viral vectors have been developed as an alternative to recombinant viruses in order to avoid the problems of these latter, especially the immune response of the host. Among 29 CF gene therapy clinical trials, about one-third were conducted with synthetic vectors, essentially cationic lipids. These demonstrated a noticeable although still modest transfection efficacy with transient expression of the transgene. Furthermore, these formulations induced a low toxicity and only few side-effects contrary to viral vectors. Current researches aim to develop more efficient non-viral formulations through optimizations of the chemical vectors as well as that of the nucleic acid sequences to deliver.

This included the assumption that development was essential to understanding the evolutionary process. This present article reassesses the Darwinian theory of pangenesis in order to revisit its historical value. The conclusion is that the theory of pangenesis was well-suited to its time, and additionally, reflections of this assumption can be found in work in new areas known as evolutionary biology of development (evo-devo) and epigenetics.

Here, we investigated the effect of psychosocial experiences on gene expression in peripheral blood immune cells of children with asthma in Metro Detroit. Using RNA-sequencing and a new machine learning approach, we identified transcriptional signatures of 19 variables including psychosocial factors, blood cell composition, and asthma symptoms. Importantly, we found 169 genes associated with asthma or allergic disease that are regulated by psychosocial factors and 344 significant gene-environment interactions for gene expression levels. These results demonstrate that immune gene expression mediates the link between negative psychosocial experiences and asthma risk.

Gene-Gene Interactions among SPRYs for Nonsyndromic Cleft Lip/Palate	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						genetic association study; cleft palate; congenital abnormalities; birth defects; single-nucleotide polymorphism; case-parent trios	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; OROFACIAL CLEFTS; LIP; PALATE; VARIANTS; RISK; GROWTH; METAANALYSES; IDENTIFY; SPROUTY2	Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is a common birth defect with a complex genetic architecture. Gene-gene interactions have been increasingly regarded as contributing to the etiology of NSCL/P. A recent genome-wide association study revealed that a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism at SPRY1 in 4q28.1 showed a significant association with NSCL/P. In the current study, we explored the role of 3 SPRY genes in the etiology of NSCL/P by detecting gene-gene interactions: SPRY1, SPRY2, and SPRY4-with SPRY3 excluded due to its special location on the X chromosome. We selected markers in 3 SPRY genes to test for gene-gene interactions using 1,908 case-parent trios recruited from an international consortium established for a genome-wide association study of nonsyndromic oral clefts. As the trios came from populations with different ancestries, subgroup analyses were conducted among Europeans and Asians. Cordell's method based on conditional logistic regression models was applied to test for potential gene-gene interactions via the statistical package TRIO in R software. Gene-gene interaction analyses yielded 10 pairs of SNPs in Europeans and 6 pairs in Asians that achieved significance after Bonferroni correction. The significant interactions were confirmed in the 10,000-permutation tests (empirical P = 0.003 for the most significant interaction). The study identified gene-gene interactions among SPRY genes among 1,908 NSCL/P trios, which revealed the importance of potential gene-gene interactions for understanding the genetic architecture of NSCL/P. The evidence of gene-gene interactions in this study also provided clues for future biological studies to further investigate the mechanism of how SPRY genes participate in the development of NSCL/P.

In this study, we redefined circadian-regulated genes based on published results in the mouse liver and compared them with other gene groups defined relative to circadian regulations, especially the non-circadian-regulated genes expressed in liver at multiple molecular levels from gene position to protein expression based on integrative analyses of different datasets from the literature. Based on the intra-tissue analysis, the liver circadian genes or LCGs show unique features when compared to other gene groups. First, LCGs in general have less neighboring genes and larger in both genomic and 3' UTR lengths but shorter in CDS (coding sequence) lengths. Second, LCGs have higher mRNA and protein abundance, higher temporal expression variations, and shorter mRNA half-life. Third, more than 60% of LCGs form major co-expression clusters centered in four temporal windows: dawn, day, dusk, and night. In addition, larger and smaller LCGs are found mainly expressed in the day and night temporal windows, respectively, and we believe that LCGs are well-partitioned into the gene expression regulatory network that takes advantage of gene size, expression constraint, and chromosomal architecture. Based on inter-tissue analysis, more than half of LCGs are ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues but only show rhythmical expression in one or limited number of tissues. LCGs show at least three-fold lower expression variations across the temporal windows than those among different tissues, and this observation suggests that temporal expression variations regulated by the circadian system is relatively subtle as compared with the tissue expression variations formed during development. Taken together, we suggest that the circadian system selects gene parameters in a cost effective way to improve tissue-specific functions by adapting temporal variations from the environment over evolutionary time scales.

In order so, 17 commonly used genes were analyzed in Wistar rat duodenum, jejunum, ileum and liver following a fat gavage and at two time periods. These reference genes were also tested in liver from Zucker (fa/fa) on a long-term dietary trial. Four strategies were used to select the most suitable reference gene for each tissue: ranking according to biological coefficient of variation and further validation by statistical comparison among groups, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper programs. No agreement was observed among these approaches for a particular gene, nor a common gene for all tissues. Furthermore we demonstrated that normalising using an inadequate reference conveyed into false negative and positive results. The selection of genes provided by BestKeeper resulted in more reliable results than the other statistical packages. According to this program, Tbp, Ubc, Hprt and Rn18s were the best reference genes for duodenum, jejunum, ileum and liver, respectively following a fat gavage in Wistar rats and Rn18s for liver in another rat strain on a long-term dietary intervention. Therefore. BestKeeper is highly recommendable to select the most stable gene to be used as internal standard and the selection of a specific reference expression gene requires a validation for each tissue and experimental design.

Epistasis, defined as the effect of one locus being dependent on the presence of 'modifier genes', may contribute to explain the missing heritability of complex phenotypes such as EL. We assessed the potential association of epistasis among candidate polymorphisms related to physical capacity, as well as antioxidant defense and cardiometabolic traits, and EL in the Japanese population. A total of 1565 individuals were studied, subdivided into 822 middle-aged controls and 743 centenarians. Results: We found a FOXOA3 rs2802292 T-allele-dependent association of fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FDNC5) rs16835198 with EL: the frequency of carriers of the FOXOA3 rs2802292 T-allele among individuals with the rs16835198 GG genotype was significantly higher in cases than in controls (P < 0.05). On the other hand, among non-carriers of the APOE 'risk' epsilon 4-allele, the frequency of the FDNC5 rs16835198 G-allele was higher in cases than in controls (48.4% vs. 43.6%, P < 0.05). Among carriers of the 'non-risk' APOE epsilon 2-allele, the frequency of the rs16835198 G-allele was higher in cases than in controls (49% vs. 37.3%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The association of FDNC5 rs16835198 with EL seems to depend on the presence of the FOXOA3 rs2802292 T-allele and we report a novel association between FNDC5 rs16835198 stratified by the presence of the APOE epsilon 2/epsilon 4-allele and EL. More research on 'gene*gene' and 'gene*environment' effects is needed in the field of EL.

Gene Set Correlation Analysis and Visualization Using Gene Expression Data	CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Gene set enrichment analyses; gene set correlation analysis; co-inertia analysis; covariance; p53 gene expression data; gene set analysis		Background: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) provide a useful and powerful approach to identify differentially expressed gene sets with prior biological knowledge. Several GSEA algorithms have been proposed to perform enrichment analyses on groups of genes. However, many of these algorithms have focused on the identification of differentially expressed gene sets in a given phenotype. Objective: In this paper, we propose a gene set analytic framework, Gene Set Correlation Analysis (GSCoA), that simultaneously measures within and between gene sets variation to identify sets of genes enriched for differential expression and highly co-related pathways. Methods: We apply co-inertia analysis to the comparisons of cross- gene sets in gene expression data to measure the co-structure of expression profiles in pairs of gene sets. Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is one multivariate method to identify trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets, which contain the same samples. The objective of CIA is to seek ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) of two gene sets such that the square covariance between the projections of the gene sets on successive axes is maximized. Simulation studies illustrate that CIA offers superior performance in identifying corelationships between gene sets in all simulation settings when compared to correlation-based gene set methods. Result and Conclusion: We also combine between-gene set CIA and GSEA to discover the relationships between gene sets significantly associated with phenotypes. In addition, we provide a graphical technique for visualizing and simultaneously exploring the associations between and within gene sets and their interaction and network. We then demonstrate the integration of within and between gene sets variation using CIA and GSEA, applied to the p53 gene expression data using the c2 curated gene sets. Ultimately, the GSCoA approach provides an attractive tool for the identification and visualization of novel associations between pairs of gene sets by integrating corelationships between gene sets into gene set analysis.

Genes are determinants of difference. Phenotypes are defined as a gene's effects relative to some alternative whereas the environment is defined as all parts of the world that are shared by the alternatives being compared. Environments choose among phenotypes and thereby choose among genes. By this process, successful gene sequences become stores of information about what works in the environment. The strategic gene is defined as a set of gene tokens that combines 'actor' tokens responsible for an effect with 'recipient' tokens whose replication is thereby enhanced. This set of tokens can extend across the boundaries of individual organisms, or other levels of selection, as these are traditionally defined.

For gene transfer and ectopic expression, adenoviral, adeno-associated virus (AAV) or retroviral vectors were used. The feasibility of radioprotective gene therapy is discussed in consideration of the application of cytoprotective agents and small-molecule protectors. Expert opinion: Further vector optimization for targeted cell-specific transduction and for more stable or regulated transgene expression is still required. However, radioprotective gene therapy represents a very promising method for reducing radiotherapy-related cytotoxicity of normal tissue cells and thus may improve therapy success and the patient's quality of life.

However, it is hard to determine which gene should have priority as a target for further functional experiments if a CNV is rare or a singleton. In this study, we attempted to overcome this issue by using two approaches: by assessing the influences of gene dosage sensitivity and gene expression sensitivity. Dosage sensitive genes derived from two-round whole-genome duplication in previous studies. In addition, we proposed a cross-sectional omics approach that utilizes open data from GTEx to assess the effect of whole-genome CNVs on gene expression. Methods Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 was used to detect CNVs by PennCNV and CNV Workshop. After quality controls for population stratification, family relationship and CNV detection, 287 patients with narcolepsy, 133 patients with essential hypersomnia, 380 patients with panic disorders, 164 patients with autism, 784 patients with Alzheimer disease and 1280 healthy individuals remained for the enrichment analysis. Results Overall, significant enrichment of dosage sensitive genes was found across patients with narcolepsy, panic disorders and autism. Particularly, significant enrichment of dosage-sensitive genes in duplications was observed across all diseases except for Alzheimer disease. For deletions, less or no enrichment of dosage-sensitive genes with deletions was seen in the patients when compared to the healthy individuals. Interestingly, significant enrichments of genes with expression sensitivity in brain were observed in patients with panic disorder and autism. While duplications presented a higher burden, deletions did not cause significant differences when compared to the healthy individuals. When we assess the effect of sensitivity to genome dosage and gene expression at the same time, the highest ratio of enrichment was observed in the group including dosage-sensitive genes and genes with expression sensitivity only in brain. In addition, shared CNV regions among the five neuropsychiatric diseases were also investigated. Conclusions This study contributed the evidence that dosage-sensitive genes are associated with CNVs among neuropsychiatric diseases. In addition, we utilized open data from GTEx to assess the effect of whole-genome CNVs on gene expression. We also investigated shared CNV region among neuropsychiatric diseases.

Gene fusion of heterophyletic gamma-globin genes in platyrrhine primates	JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article						gene duplication; gene fusion; gene conversion; recombination; globins; primates	NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; EVOLUTION; MODEL; TOOL	We performed phylogenetic analyses of HBG genes to assess its origin and interspecific variation among primates. Our analyses showed variation in HBG genes copy number ranging from one to three, some of them pseudogenes. For platyrrhines HBG genes, phylogenetic reconstructions of flanking regions recovered orthologous clades with distinct topologies for 5 and 3 flanking regions. The 5 region originated in the common ancestor of platyrrhines but the 3 region had an anthropoid origin. We hypothesize that the platyrrhine HBG genes of 5 and 3 heterophyletic origins arose from subsequent fusions of the (earlier) platyrrhine 5 portion and the (later) anthropoid 3 portion.

A common approach is to infer signaling activity of pathways from gene expression. However, mapping gene expression to pathway components disregards the effect of post-translational modifications, and downstream signatures represent very specific experimental conditions. Here we present PROGENy, a method that overcomes both limitations by leveraging a large compendium of publicly available perturbation experiments to yield a common core of Pathway RespOnsive GENes. Unlike pathway mapping methods, PROGENy can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival. Collectively, these results show that PROGENy accurately infers pathway activity from gene expression in a wide range of conditions.

J	Zhao, JY; Zhu, Y; Xiong, MM				Zhao, Jinying; Zhu, Yun; Xiong, Momiao			Genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis for next-generation sequencing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							ASSOCIATION SIGNALS; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; DISEASE; NETWORK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SAMPLES; SCAN; RISK; LOCI; SET	The critical barrier in interaction analysis for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is that the traditional pairwise interaction analysis that is suitable for common variants is difficult to apply to rare variants because of their prohibitive computational time, large number of tests and low power. The great challenges for successful detection of interactions with NGS data are (1) the demands in the paradigm of changes in interaction analysis; (2) severe multiple testing; and (3) heavy computations. To meet these challenges, we shift the paradigm of interaction analysis between two SNPs to interaction analysis between two genomic regions. In other words, we take a gene as a unit of analysis and use functional data analysis techniques as dimensional reduction tools to develop a novel statistic to collectively test interaction between all possible pairs of SNPs within two genome regions. By intensive simulations, we demonstrate that the functional logistic regression for interaction analysis has the correct type 1 error rates and higher power to detect interaction than the currently used methods. The proposed method was applied to a coronary artery disease dataset from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) dataset, and the early-onset myocardial infarction (EOMI) exome sequence datasets with European origin from the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project. We discovered that 6 of 27 pairs of significantly interacted genes in the FHS were replicated in the independent WTCCC study and 24 pairs of significantly interacted genes after applying Bonferroni correction in the EOMI study.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, is a major cause of cancer-related death. Knowledge of CRC-related genes may help to make an early detection of CRC and develop gene-targeted treatment schemes to significantly improve a patient's prognosis and reduce the mortality. The very first and basic steps one needs to take are the screening and identification of CRC-related genes. Here, we presented a computational method to predict CRC-related genes based on JRip, a rule abstracting algorithm, and optimized its data inputs by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method and incremental feature selection (IFS). 77 genes were compiled from KEGG CRC pathway and through text mining as CRC-related gene candidates, while 385 other genes were randomly selected as the non-CRC gene candidates. All these 462 genes were encoded according to their Gene Ontology annotation, each producing a 2669-dimensional vector which was drastically reduced to 52 dimensions after feature selection. A rule set including 7 criteria was revealed by our method, yielding an overall prediction accuracy of 0.9242 and MCC of 0.7259. And analysis of the rule set and optimal features may shed some light on how CRC genes can be separated from non-CRC genes based on GO terms.

In order to investigate the biological effects of degradation of poly(ADP-ribose), knockdown of the poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) gene was performed by introducing a short interfering RNA (siRNA)-pool into He La S3 cells. Notably, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins did not accumulate in the cells. Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR analysis and a transient transfection assay revealed that poly(ADPribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene/protein expression and its promoter activity were reduced in the PARG knockdown cells. These results suggest that the amount of poly(ADP-ribose) in a cell is regulated under the control of PARP1/PARG gene expression balance. Furthermore, in this study, we showed that PARG-siRNA enhanced cell death induced by staurosporine (STS). Thus, we propose a PARG-siRNA utilizing gene-therapy for cancer treatment.

J	Kim, CY; Lee, I				Kim, Chan Yeong; Lee, Insuk			Functional gene networks based on the gene neighborhood in metagenomes	ANIMAL CELLS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Metagenome; gene neighborhood; functional gene network	DATABASE; VIRULENCE; GENOMICS	The gene neighborhood in prokaryotic genomes has been effectively utilized in inferring co-functional networks in various organisms. Previously, such genomic context information has been sought among completely assembled prokaryotic genomes. Here, we present a method to infer functional gene networks according to the gene neighborhood in metagenome contigs, which are incompletely assembled genomic fragments. Given that the amount of metagenome sequence data has now surpassed that of completely assembled prokaryotic genomes in the public domain, we expect benefits of inferring networks by the metagenome-based gene neighborhood. We generated co-functional networks for diverse taxonomical species using metagenomics contigs derived from the human microbiome and the ocean microbiome. We found that the networks based on the metagenome gene neighborhood outperformed those based on 1748 completely assembled prokaryotic genomes. We also demonstrated that the metagenome-based gene neighborhood could predict genes related to virulence-associated phenotypes in a bacterial pathogen, indicating that metagenome-based functional links could be sufficiently predictive for some phenotypes of medical importance. Owing to the exponential growth of metagenome sequence data in public repositories, metagenome-based inference of co-functional networks will facilitate understanding of gene functions and pathways in diverse species.

To investigate the role of WDR36 and P53 sequence variations in POAG susceptibility. METHODS. The authors performed a case-control genetic association study in 268 unrelated Spanish patients (POAG1) and 380 control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. WDR36 sequence variations were screened by either direct DNA sequencing or denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. P53 polymorphisms p.R72P and c.97-147ins16bp were analyzed by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and PCR, respectively. Positive SNP and haplotype associations were reanalyzed in a second sample of 211 patients and in combined cases (n = 479). RESULTS. The authors identified almost 50 WDR36 sequence variations, of which approximately two-thirds were rare and one-third were polymorphisms. Approximately half the variants were novel. Eight patients (2.9%) carried rare mutations that were not identified in the control group (P = 0.001). Six Tag SNPs were expected to be structured in three common haplotypes. Haplotype H2 was consistently associated with the disease (P = 0.0024 in combined cases). According to a dominant model, genotypes containing allele P of the P53 p.R72P SNP slightly increased glaucoma risk. Glaucoma susceptibility associated with different WDR36 genotypes also increased significantly in combination with the P53 RP risk genotype, indicating the existence of a genetic interaction. For instance, the OR of the H2 diplotype estimated for POAG1 and combined cases rose approximately 1.6 times in the two-locus genotype H2/RP. CONCLUSIONS. Rare WDR36 variants and the P53 p.R72P polymorphism behaved as moderate glaucoma risk factors in Spanish patients. The authors provide evidence for a genetic interaction between WDR36 and P53 variants in POAG susceptibility, although this finding must be confirmed in other populations.

Explant systems that are not readily available in other organisms give Xenopus embryos a unique place in these studies, facilitated by the recent sequencing of the Xenopus laevis genome. A number of upstream regulators of zic gene expression have been identified, such as inhibition of BMP signaling, as well as calcium, FGF, and canonical Wnt signaling. Screens using induced ectodermal explants have identified genes that are direct targets of Zic proteins during early neural development and neural crest specification. These direct targets include Xfeb (also called glipr2; hindbrain development), aqp3b (dorsal marginal zone in gastrula embryos and neural folds), snail family members (premigratory neural crest), genes that play roles in retinoic acid signaling, noncanonical Wnt signaling, and mesoderm development, in addition to a variety of genes some with and many without known roles during neural or neural crest development. Functional experiments in Xenopus embryos demonstrated the involvement of Zic family members in left-right determination, early neural patterning, formation of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, and neural crest specification. The role of zic genes in cell proliferation vs. differentiation remains unclear, and the activities of Zic factors as inhibitors or activators of canonical Wnt signaling may be dependent on developmental context. Overall, Xenopus has contributed much to our understanding of how Zic transcriptional activities shape the development of the embryo and contribute to disease.

These discoveries will both provide the basis for including genetic tests in clinical practice and improve diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. By searching through several databases (OMIM, HGMD, and EpilepsyGene) and recent publications on PubMed, we found 977 genes that are associated with epilepsy. We classified these genes into 4 categories according to the manifestation of epilepsy in phenotypes. We found 84 genes that are considered as epilepsy genes: genes that cause epilepsies or syndromes with epilepsy as the core symptom. 73 genes were listed as neurodevelopment-associated genes: genes associated with both brain-development malformations and epilepsy. Several genes (536) were epilepsy-related: genes associated with both physical or other systemic abnormalities and epilepsy or seizures. We found 284 additional genes putatively associated with epilepsy; this requires further verification. These integrated data will provide new insights useful for both including genetic tests in the clinical practice and evaluating the results of genetic tests. We also summarized the epilepsy-associated genes according to their function, with the goal to better characterize the association between genes and epilepsies and to further understand the mechanisms underlying epilepsy.

Noninvasive tracking of gene transcript and neuroprotection after gene therapy	GENE THERAPY			English	Article							COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR; FACTOR G-CSF; FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; CARDIAC-ARREST; IN-VIVO; LIVING BRAINS; MOUSE MODEL; CELL-DEATH; MICE; MRI	Gene therapy holds exceptional potential for translational medicine by improving the products of defective genes in diseases and/or providing necessary biologics from endogenous sources during recovery processes. However, validating methods for the delivery, distribution and expression of the exogenous genes from such therapy can generally not be applicable to monitor effects over the long term because they are invasive. We report here that human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) complimentary DNA (cDNA) encoded in self-complementary adeno-associated virus-type 2 adeno-associated virus, as delivered through eye drops at multiple time points after cerebral ischemia using bilateral carotid occlusion for 60 min (BCAO-60) led to significant reduction in mortality rates, cerebral atrophy and neurological deficits in C57black6 mice. Most importantly, we validated hG-CSF cDNA expression using translatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in living brains. This noninvasive approach for monitoring exogenous gene expression in the brains has potential for great impact in the area of experimental gene therapy in animal models of heart attack, stroke, Alzheimer's dementia, Parkinson's disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the translation of such techniques to emergency medicine.

In plants, both hetero- and euchromatin can localize at the nuclear periphery, but the effect of proximity to the nuclear periphery on gene expression remains largely unknown. This study explores the putative function of Seh1 and Nup50a nucleoporins on gene expression by using the Lac Operator / Lac Repressor (LacI-LacO) system adapted to Arabidopsis thaliana. We used LacO fused to the luciferase reporter gene (LacO:Luc) to investigate whether binding of the LacO:Luc transgene to nucleoporin:LacI protein fusions alters luciferase expression. Two separate nucleoporin-LacI-YFP fusions were introduced into single insert, homozygous LacO:Luc Arabidopsis plants. Homozygous plants carrying LacO:Luc and a single insert of either Seh1-LacI-YFP or Nup50a-LacI-YFP were tested for luciferase activity and compared to plants containing LacO:Luc only. Seh1-LacI-YFP increased, while Nup50a-LacI-YFP decreased luciferase activity. Seh1-LacI-YFP accumulated at the nuclear periphery as expected, while Nup50a-LacI-YFP was nucleoplasmic and was not selected for further study. Protein and RNA levels of luciferase were quantified by western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively. Increased luciferase activity in LacO:Luc+Seh1-LacI-YFP plants was correlated with increased luciferase protein and RNA levels. This change of luciferase expression was abolished by disruption of LacI-LacO binding by treating with IPTG in young seedlings, rosette leaves and inflorescences. This study suggests that association with the nuclear periphery is involved in the regulation of gene expression in plants.

From simulations of a stochastic model of gene expression at the nucleotide and codon levels we show that, within realistic parameter values, the nucleotide length affects RNA and protein mean levels, as well as the expected transient time for RNA and protein numbers to change, following a signal. Fluctuations in RNA and protein numbers are found to be minimized for a small range of lengths, which matches the means of the distributions of lengths found in E. colt of both essential and non-essential genes. The variance of the length distribution for essential genes is found to be smaller than for non-essential genes, implying that these distributions are far from random. Finally, gene lengths are shown to affect the kinetics of a genetic switch, namely, the correlation between temporal proteins numbers, the stability of the two noisy attractors of the switch, and how biased is the choice of noisy attractor. The stability increases with gene length due to increased 'memory' about the previous states of the switch. We argue that, by affecting the dynamics of gene expression and of genetic circuits, gene lengths are subject to selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have clarified the structure, expression, and roles of lophotrochozoan Zic family genes. Zic genes in oligochaete annelid Tubifex tubifex (freshwater sludge worm) and polychaete annelid Capitella teleta (bristle worm) are commonly expressed in a subset of developing brain and mesoderm derivatives. The latter includes the naive mesoderm and the associated chaetal sacs in each body segment, although the segmentation processes differ between the two species. Furthermore, in brachiopod Terebratalia transversa (lamp shell), Zic is expressed in the anterior ectodermal domains and mesodermal derivatives, including those associated with the chaetal sacs. This result suggests the common involvement of Zic genes in the development of chaetae, a lophotrochozoan novelty acquired in the course of evolution. In addition, the highly simplified lophotrochozoan Dicyema acuticephalum (dicyemid mesozoan, a cephalopod endoparasite), which lost its gut, nervous system, and muscles during evolution, expresses its Zic genes in hermaphroditic gonads, highlighting the role of Zic genes in germ cell development. The role of Zic in head regeneration was revealed in studies on platyhelminth Schmidtea mediterranea (freshwater planarian). Planarian Zic expression was induced in a subpopulation of neoblasts that includes adult pluripotent stem cells. It is needed for head regeneration and production of an anterior signaling center. Suppression of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling underlies Zic-mediated head regeneration, reminiscent of Wnt-beta-catenin suppression by vertebrate Zic genes. Taken together, studies on the lophotrochozoan Zic genes are essential to understanding not only the roles of these genes in body plan evolution but also the molecular mechanism underlying adult stem cell regulation.

They are remarkably diverse in terms of structure and function. Unique potency and selectivity profiles for a range of neuronal targets have made several conotoxins valuable as research tools, drug leads and even therapeutics, and has resulted in a concerted and increasing drive to identify and characterise new conotoxins. Conotoxins are translated from mRNA as peptide precursors, and cDNA sequencing is now the primary method for identification of new conotoxin sequences. As a result, gene superfamily, a classification based on precursor signal peptide identity, has become the most convenient method of conotoxin classification. Here we review each of the described conotoxin gene superfamilies, with a focus on the structural and functional diversity present in each. This review is intended to serve as a practical guide to conotoxin superfamilies and to facilitate interpretation of the increasing number of conotoxin precursor sequences being identified by targeted-cDNA sequencing and more recently high-throughput transcriptome sequencing.

Observational studies have shown that relationships between DNA sequence variants and risk factors are significantly different between sedentary and physically active individuals, while exercise intervention studies have demonstrated that genetic variation contributes significantly to interindividual variation in responsiveness to exercise training. The knowledge base on gene-activity interactions will grow considerably within a few years when large observational genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia will report their findings. Progress with exercise intervention studies will be slower because of resource requirements. However, such studies are desperately needed to fully understand the genetics as well as the exercise biology of complex traits and to confirm the gene-exercise interactions derived from observational studies. Furthermore, development of personalized exercise medicine applications will be difficult or even impossible without a proper understanding of gene-exercise interactions.

Dopamine response gene pathways in dorsal striatum MSNs from a gene expression viewpoint: cAMP-mediated gene networks	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Dorsal striatum; Mouse model of chronic social conflicts; DARPP-32; Alternative splicing; RNA-seq	DISTINCT ROLES; DARPP-32; D1; PHOSPHORYLATION; RECEPTORS; NEURONS; DEPHOSPHORYLATION; MODULATION; BEHAVIOR; PPP1R1B	Background Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) comprise the main body (95% in mouse) of the dorsal striatum neurons and represent dopaminoceptive GABAergic neurons. The cAMP (cyclic Adenosine MonoPhosphate)-mediated cascade of excitation and inhibition responses observed in MSN intracellular signal transduction is crucial for neuroscience research due to its involvement in the motor and behavioral functions. In particular, all types of addictions are related to MSNs. Shedding the light on the mechanics of the above-mentioned cascade is of primary importance for this research domain. Results A mouse model of chronic social conflicts in daily agonistic interactions was used to analyze dorsal striatum neurons genes implicated in cAMP-mediated phosphorylation activation pathways specific for MSNs. Based on expression correlation analysis, we succeeded in dissecting Drd1- and Drd2-dopaminoceptive neurons (D1 and D2, correspondingly) gene pathways. We also found that D1 neurons genes clustering are split into two oppositely correlated states, passive and active ones, the latter apparently corresponding to D1 firing stage upon protein kinase A (PKA) activation. We observed that under defeat stress in chronic social conflicts the loser mice manifest overall depression of dopamine-mediated MSNs activity resulting in previously reported reduced motor activity, while the aggressive mice with positive fighting experience (aggressive mice) feature an increase in both D1-active phase and D2 MSNs genes expression leading to hyperactive behavior pattern corresponded by us before. Based on the alternative transcript isoforms expression analysis, it was assumed that many genes (Drd1, Adora1, Pde10, Ppp1r1b, Gnal), specifically those in D1 neurons, apparently remain transcriptionally repressed via the reversible mechanism of promoter CpG island silencing, resulting in alternative promoter usage following profound reduction in their expression rate. Conclusion Based on the animal stress model dorsal striatum pooled tissue RNA-Seq data restricted to cAMP related genes subset we elucidated MSNs steady states exhaustive projection for the first time. We correspond the existence of D1 active state not explicitly outlined before, and connected with dynamic dopamine neurotransmission cycles. Consequently, we were also able to indicate an oscillated postsynaptic dopamine vs glutamate action pattern in the course of the neurotransmission cycles.

The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel (RAS EP) assessed published and other publicly available evidence supporting the association of 19 genes with RASopathy conditions. Using the semiquantitative literature curation method developed by the ClinGen Gene Curation Working Group, evidence for each gene was curated and scored for Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, NS with multiple lentigines, and Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. The curated evidence supporting each gene-disease relationship was then discussed and approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel. Each association's strength was classified as definitive, strong, moderate, limited, disputed, or no evidence. Eleven genes were classified as definitively associated with at least one RASopathy condition. Two genes classified as strong for association with at least one RASopathy condition while one gene was moderate and three were limited. The RAS EP also disputed the association of two genes for all RASopathy conditions. Overall, our results provide a greater understanding of the different gene-disease relationships within the RASopathies and can help in guiding and directing clinicians, patients, and researchers who are identifying variants in individuals with a suspected RASopathy.

Comparative GO: A Web Application for Comparative Gene Ontology and Gene Ontology-Based Gene Selection in Bacteria	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; DATABASE; TOOL; ANNOTATION; DISEASE; TERMS	The primary means of classifying new functions for genes and proteins relies on Gene Ontology (GO), which defines genes/proteins using a controlled vocabulary in terms of their Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Component. The challenge is to present this information to researchers to compare and discover patterns in multiple datasets using visually comprehensible and user-friendly statistical reports. Importantly, while there are many GO resources available for eukaryotes, there are none suitable for simultaneous, graphical and statistical comparison between multiple datasets. In addition, none of them supports comprehensive resources for bacteria. By using Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model, we identified and collected GO resources including genes, proteins, taxonomy and GO relationships from NCBI, UniProt and GO organisations. Then, we designed database tables in PostgreSQL database server and developed a Java application to extract data from source files and loaded into database automatically. We developed a PHP web application based on Model-View-Control architecture, used a specific data structure as well as current and novel algorithms to estimate GO graphs parameters. We designed different navigation and visualization methods on the graphs and integrated these into graphical reports. This tool is particularly significant when comparing GO groups between multiple samples (including those of pathogenic bacteria) from different sources simultaneously. Comparing GO protein distribution among up- or down-regulated genes from different samples can improve understanding of biological pathways, and mechanism(s) of infection. It can also aid in the discovery of genes associated with specific function(s) for investigation as a novel vaccine or therapeutic targets.

However, for fruit fly, a popular animal model, gene matrixes for GSEA are unavailable. This study provides the pathway-targeting gene matrixes based on Reactome and KEGG database for fruit fly. An expression profiling containing neurons or glia of fruit fly was used to validate the feasibility of the generated gene matrixes. We validated the gene matrixes and identified characteristic neuronal and glial pathways, including mRNA splicing and endocytosis. In conclusion, we generated and validated the feasibility of Reactome and KEGG gene matrix files, which may benefit future profiling studies using Drosophila.

Gene ontology enrichment analysis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia-associated genes	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Review								Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a commonly occurring major congenital anomaly with a profound impact on neonatal mortality. The etiology of CDH is poorly understood and is complicated by multiple clinical presentations, reflecting the location and type of diaphragm defect. With the increased power of genetic screening, more genes are being associated with CDH, creating a knowledge gap between CDH-associated genes and their contribution to diaphragm embryogenesis. Our goal was to investigate CDH-associated genes and identify common pathways that may lead to abnormal diaphragm development. A comprehensive list of CDH-associated genes was identified from the literature and categorized according to multiple factors, including type of CDH. We undertook a large-scale gene function analysis using gene ontology to identify significantly enriched biological pathways and molecular functions associated with our gene set. We identified 218 CDH-associated genes. Our gene ontology analysis showed that genes representing distinct biological pathways are significantly enriched in relation to different clinical presentations of CDH. This includes retinoic acid signaling in Bochdalek CDH, myogenesis in diaphragm eventration, and angiogenesis in central tendon defects. We have identified unique genotype-phenotype relationships highlighting the major genetic drivers of the different types of CDH.	[Dalmer, Timothy R.

Gene mutations in parasitic diseases Part II: Parasite gene mutations	PARASITOLOGISTS UNITED JOURNAL			English	Review						Anti-parasitic drugs; drug resistance; gene mutation; false diagnosis		Gene mutation may occur either in the parasite or in the host, which may be beneficial or harmful for each. As we previously discussed, part I covered causes and types of gene mutations as well as their relation(s) to or effect(s) on parasitic diseases; part II deals with parasite gene mutations. The most apparent manifestation is drug resistance especially with anti-malarial drugs for falciparum malaria. The majority of P. falciparum isolates are able to undergo gene mutations in genes encoding enzymes that control drug uptake. Parasite gene mutations are suggested to influence parasite virulence in toxoplasmosis and malignant malaria, and to have impact on the occurrence of malignancy in schistosomiasis and clonorchiasis. It is intended in the present review to present mechanism(s) of drug resistance due to parasite gene mutations, with special emphasis on anti-malarial drugs, albendazole, metronidazole, and other drugs used in treatment of African trypanosomiasis and toxoplasmosis. The review also presents other effects of parasite gene mutations on disease outcome and progress as well as occurrence of false diagnosis in falciparum malaria using ICTs utelizing histidine rich protein.

These mating systems are all controlled by the mating type (MAT) genes, some of which are conserved, even among distantly related genera. In order to facilitate effective communication between researchers, a system was established in 2000 to name these genes and this has subsequently been widely applied. However, due to the rapid growth in the number of described MAT genes in the Pezizomycotina, an evaluation of the manner in which the nomenclature system has been applied is warranted and revisions should be considered. We address this challenge by doing a systematic review of the nomenclature associated with the MAT1 locus and its associated genes described in the Pezizomycotina. Several problems in the application of the nomenclature system were identified and addressed. These included proposed revisions of the nomenclature system to provide a more accurate description of the mating-type genes. We anticipate that this review will reduce confusion and that it will be useful in future characterisation of mating-type genes. (C) 2017 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There are several reports on the expression of LACK through different life-cycle stages of genus Leishmania, but only a few of them have focused on L. tropica. Methods: The present study provides details of the cloning, DNA sequencing and gene expression of LACK in this parasite species. First, several local isolates of Leishmania parasites were typed in our laboratory using PCR technique to verify of Leishmania parasite species. After that, LACK gene was amplified and cloned into a vector for sequencing. Finally, the expression of this molecule in logarithmic and stationary growth phase promastigotes, as well as in amastigotes, was evaluated by Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technique. Results: The typing result confirmed that all our local isolates belong to L. tropica. LACK gene sequence was determined and high similarity was observed with the sequences of other Leishmania species. Furthermore, the expression of LACK gene in both promastigotes and amastigotes forms was confirmed. Conclusion: Overall, the data set the stage for future studies of the properties and immune role of LACK gene products.

Protein molecules may bound to DNA promoters and block their own transcription. We derive analytical expressions for the variance of the number of protein molecules in the stationary state in the self-consistent mean-field approximation. We show that the Fano factor (the variance divided by the mean value) is bigger for the one-gene case than for two gene copies and the difference decreases to zero as frequencies of binding and unbinding increase to infinity.

Bayesian assignment of gene ontology terms to gene expression experiments	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) / Conference of the Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB)	SEP 09-12, 2012	Basel, SWITZERLAND	Swiss Inst Bioinformat (SIB)			TOOLS; SELECTION; REVEALS	Motivation: Gene expression assays allow for genome scale analyses of molecular biological mechanisms. State-of-the-art data analysis provides lists of involved genes, either by calculating significance levels of mRNA abundance or by Bayesian assessments of gene activity. A common problem of such approaches is the difficulty of interpreting the biological implication of the resulting gene lists. This lead to an increased interest in methods for inferring high-level biological information. A common approach for representing high level information is by inferring gene ontology (GO) terms which may be attributed to the expression data experiment. Results: This article proposes a probabilistic model for GO term inference. Modelling assumes that gene annotations to GO terms are available and gene involvement in an experiment is represented by a posterior probabilities over gene-specific indicator variables. Such probability measures result from many Bayesian approaches for expression data analysis. The proposed model combines these indicator probabilities in a probabilistic fashion and provides a probabilistic GO term assignment as a result. Experiments on synthetic and microarray data suggest that advantages of the proposed probabilistic GO term inference over statistical test-based approaches are in particular evident for sparsely annotated GO terms and in situations of large uncertainty about gene activity. Provided that appropriate annotations exist, the proposed approach is easily applied to inferring other high level assignments like pathways.

Using the explanation difference of independent variables on dependent variable (class), we define three indicators for global gene selection, which takes into accounts the combined effects of all the genes and the correlation among the genes. Integrated with the linear kernel support vector classifier (SVC), the proposed method is tested by MIT acute myeloid leukemia/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML/ALL) and small round blue cell tumors (SRBCT) data sets. A subset of specific genes with small numbers and high identification are obtained. The results indicate that our proposed PLS-based method for tumor-specific genes selection is highly efficient. Compared to the literature, the selected specific genes from both two-category dataset AML/ALL and multicategory dataset SRBCT are credible. Further investigation shows that the proposed gene-selection method is robust. Overall, the proposed method can effectively solve feature-selection problem on high-dimensional small sample. At the same time, it has good performance for multicategory classification as well.

J	Brandt, R				Brandt, Reuven			The ethical gene	BIOETHICS			English	Article; Early Access						assisted reproduction; genetic modification; genetics; germline		In this paper I argue that current law and policy governing germline genetic modification are overly broad and in fact prohibit medical interventions normally considered unobjectionable. The root of the problem lies in the fact law and policy tend to espouse a near categorical ban on medical interventions that alter germline DNA. However, if we pay close attention to the biological mechanisms at play we see that many standard medical interventions result in alterations to DNA that can be transmitted to future generations. The correct focus of policy and regulation thus ought to be determining which kinds of transmissible genetic modifications ought to be permitted, and not whether they should be permitted at all. Given that the scientific classification of biological structures involved in the inheritance of traits is unlikely to be in itself ethically significant, ethicists ought to develop a definition of 'gene' fit for ethical purposes.

The past decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to hearing, and the environmental and genetic factors that can go awry and lead to hearing loss. This in turn has sparked enormous interest in developing gene therapy approaches to treat this disorder. This review documents the most recent advances in cochlear gene therapy to restore hearing loss, and will cover viral vectors and construct designs, potential routes of delivery into the inner ear, and, lastly, the most promising genes of interest.

At the population level, identification of essential genes is accomplished by observing intolerance to loss-of-function variants. Several computational methods are available to score gene essentiality, and recent progress has been made in defining essentiality in the non-coding genome. Haploinsufficiency is emerging as a critical aspect of gene essentiality: approximately 3,000 human genes cannot tolerate loss of one of the two alleles. Genes identified as essential in human cell lines or knockout mice may be distinct from those in living humans. Reconciling these discrepancies in how we evaluate gene essentiality has applications in clinical genetics and may offer insights for drug development.	[Bartha, Istvan; di Iulio, Julia; Venter, J.

Thus, we state here that there is a need for correction for such bias when performing downstream gene-level analysis, e. g. pathway analysis and gene-set analysis. We investigate several methods of obtaining gene level statistical significance in GWAS, and compare their effectiveness in correcting such bias. We also propose a simple algorithm based on first order statistic that corrects such bias. Citation: Mirina A, Atzmon G, Ye K, Bergman A (2012) Gene Size Matters.

J	Benkler, Y				Benkler, Yochai			The Unselfish Gene	HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article								For generations, we have operated on the assumption that human beings are fundamentally selfish, and so we have built systems and organizations around monetary incentives, rewards, and punishments. That hasn't always worked very well. Now the tide is starting to turn. In fields such as evolutionary biology, psychology, sociology, political science, and experimental economics, researchers are seeing evidence that human beings are more cooperative and behave far less selfishly than we have long assumed. The success achieved by such collaborative offerings as Wikipedia, Craigslist, Facebook, and open source software has, in fact, a scientific basis. Dozens of field studies have identified highly successful cooperative systems, which are often more stable than those based on incentives. Moreover, researchers have found neural and possibly genetic evidence of a human predisposition to cooperate. Evolution may actually favor people who collaborate and societies that include such individuals. Organizations would be better off helping us to engage and embrace our generous sentiments rather than assuming that we are driven purely by self-interest. We can build collaborative systems by encouraging communication, ensuring that claims about community are authentic, fostering a feeling of solidarity, being fair, and appealing to people's intrinsic motivations.

The Xanthomonas-secreted transcription activation-like effectors (TALEs) usually function as major virulence factors, which activate the expression of the so-called "susceptibility" (S) genes for disease development. This activation is achieved via the binding of the TALEs to the effector-binding element (EBE) in the S gene promoter. However, host plants have evolved EBEs in the promoters of some otherwise silent R genes, whose expression directly causes a host cell death that is characterized by a hypersensitive response (HR). Such R genes are called E genes because they trap the pathogen TALEs in order to activate expression, and the resulting HR prevents pathogen growth and disease development. Currently, deploying E gene resistance is becoming a major component in disease resistance breeding, especially for rice bacterial blight resistance. Currently, the biochemical mechanisms, or the working pathways of the E proteins, are still fuzzy. There is no significant nucleotide sequence homology among E genes, although E proteins share some structural motifs that are probably associated with the signal transduction in the effector-triggered immunity. Here, we summarize the current knowledge regarding TALE-type avirulence proteins, E gene activation, the E protein structural traits, and the classification of E genes, in order to sharpen our understanding of the plant E genes.

This limitation has prevented researchers from rendering wild insects unable to spread disease, programing pests to ignore our crops, using genetics to precisely remove environmentally damaging invasive species, and much more. Gene drive occurs when a vertically transmitted genetic element reliably spreads through a population over generations despite providing no reproductive advantage to each host organism. Until recently, scientific efforts to take advantage of this natural phenomenon achieved only limited success. The advent of CRISPR genome editing has dramatically accelerated efforts to harness gene drive. Small groups of scientists may now be capable of unilaterally altering entire wild populations, and through them, the shared environment. Determining whether, when, and how to develop gene drive interventions responsibly will be a defining challenge of our time. Here we describe capabilities, safeguards, applications, and opportunities relevant to gene drive technologies.

Gene expression analysis	BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Review						Laboratory exercises; gene expression; biotechnology education; genomics proteomics bioinformatics	MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY; DNA	Genome scale experiments routinely produce large data sets that require computational analysis, yet there are few student-based labs that illustrate the design and execution of these experiments. In order for students to understand and participate in the genomic world, teaching labs must be available where students generate and analyze large data sets. We present a microarray-based gene expression analysis experiment that is tailored for undergraduate students. The methods in this article describe an expression analysis experiment that can also be applied to CGH and SNP experiments. Factors such as technical difficulty, duration, cost, and availability of materials and equipments are considered in the lab design. The microarray teaching lab is performed in two sessions. The first is an introductory wet bench exercise that allows students to master the basic technical skills. The second builds on the concepts and skills with students acquiring and analyzing the microarray data. This lab exercise familiarizes students with large-scale data experiments and introduces them to the initial analysis steps.

Genes and cognition	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article							HETEROGENEOUS STOCK MICE; RADIAL-MAZE PERFORMANCE; STRUCTURAL VARIATION; ABILITY; MEMORY; MOUSE; HIPPOCAMPUS; DISORDERS; AVOIDANCE; DEFICIT	Explaining individual differences in human cognition has been a prominent goal of psychological research during the last century. Converging lines of evidence from human and animal research have shown that these differences are under the influence of genetic factors. However, identifying the specific genes involved is not an easy task. The complexities of the human genome and of the definition of the concept of cognition itself are obvious reasons why understanding the genetics of cognitive abilities is so complicated. About 20,000 genes are thought to have an impact on the development and functionality of the brain and each and every one of these may in fact have an effect on information processing, and therefore on cognition. In addition, the concept of cognition itself is very broad and has often been the subject of intense debate. It is therefore important to provide a precise definition of the cognitive phenotype before analyzing the genetic influences acting on it. Furthermore, the genetics of cognition can be investigated by multiple approaches that can be applied not only to human, but also to animal research. An overview of these methods and some of the results obtained is provided in an attempt to highlight the multidisciplinary complexity of studying the genetic bases of human cognition. Furthermore, some directions for future studies are suggested, highlighting the importance of analyzing gene-environment interactions and avoiding deterministic approaches.

These genes worked as "magical bullets" to specifically silence faulty genes responsible for progression of diseases. Viral gene delivery research is far ahead of nonviral gene delivery technique. However, with more advancement in polymer science, new ways are opening for better and efficient nonviral gene delivery. But efficient delivery method is always considered as a bottleneck for gene delivery as success of which will decide the fate of gene in cells. During the past decade, it became evident that extracellular as well as intracellular barriers compromise the transfection efficiency of nonviral vectors. The challenge for gene therapy research is to pinpoint the rate-limiting steps in this complex process and implement strategies to overcome the biological physiochemical and metabolic barriers encountered during targeting. The synergy between studies that investigate the mechanism of breaking in and breaking out of nonviral gene delivery carrier through various extracellular and intracellular barriers with desired characteristics will enable the rational design of vehicles and revolutionize the treatment of various diseases.

Toll-like receptors and microbial exposure: gene-gene and gene-environment interaction in the development of atopy	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article						Atopy; endotoxin; gene-environment interaction; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk factors	SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-E; BIRTH-ORDER; TOTAL IGE; CHILDHOOD ENVIRONMENT; ASTHMA; ASSOCIATION; INNATE; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; CHILDREN	Environmental and genetic factors contribute to atopy development. High microbial exposure may confer a protective effect on atopy. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) bind microbial products and are important in activating the immune system. To assess whether interactions between microbial exposures and genes encoding TLRs (and related genes) result in atopy, genes, environmental factors and gene-environment interactions of 66 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 12 genes (TLR 1-6, 9 and 10, CD14, MD2, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and Dectin-1), and six proxy parameters of microbial exposure (sibship size, pets (three different parameters), day-care and intrauterine and childhood tobacco smoke exposure) were analysed for association with atopic phenotypes in 3,062 Dutch children (the Allergenic study). The presence of two or more older siblings increased the risk of developing high total immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels at different ages. This risk increased further in children aged 1-2 yrs carrying the minor allele of TLR6 SNP rs1039559. Furthermore, novel two-and three-factor gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were found (e. g. between sibship size, day-care and LBP SNP rs2232596). Larger sibship size is associated with increased total IgE levels. Furthermore, complex two-and three-factor interactions exist between genes and the environment. The TLRs and related genes interact with proxy parameters of high microbial exposure in atopy development.	[Koppelman, G.

Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of genes of interest can overcome the inherent problems of polyploidy and limited transformation potential that hamper functional validation studies in wheat. In this study, three potential candidate genes shown to be involved in abiotic stress response pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana were selected for VIGS experiments in wheat. These include Era1 (enhanced response to abscisic acid), Cyp707a (ABA 8-hydroxylase), and Sal1 (inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase). Gene homologues for these three genes were identified in wheat and cloned in the viral vector barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) in the antisense direction, followed by rub inoculation of BSMV viral RNA transcripts onto wheat plants. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that VIGS-treated wheat plants had significant reductions in target gene transcripts. When VIGS-treated plants generated for Era1 and Sal1 were subjected to limiting water conditions, they showed increased relative water content, improved water use efficiency, reduced gas exchange, and better vigour compared to water-stressed control plants inoculated with RNA from the empty viral vector (BSMV0). In comparison, the Cyp707a-silenced plants showed no improvement over BSMV0-inoculated plants under limited water condition. These results indicate that Era1 and Sal1 play important roles in conferring drought tolerance in wheat. Other traits affected by Era1 silencing were also studied. Delayed seed germination in Era1-silenced plants suggests this gene may be a useful target for developing resistance to pre-harvest sprouting.

The Natural History of Class I Primate Alcohol Dehydrogenases Includes Gene Duplication, Gene Loss, and Gene Conversion	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEPENDENT FORMALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE; NEIGHBOR-JOINING METHOD; LAST COMMON ANCESTOR; CLASS-III ALCOHOL; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; SUBSTITUTION RATES; LEAF MONKEYS; PROTEIN EVOLUTION; DIGESTIVE RNASES; BETA-SUBUNIT	Background: Gene duplication is a source of molecular innovation throughout evolution. However, even with massive amounts of genome sequence data, correlating gene duplication with speciation and other events in natural history can be difficult. This is especially true in its most interesting cases, where rapid and multiple duplications are likely to reflect adaptation to rapidly changing environments and life styles. This may be so for Class I of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1s), where multiple duplications occurred in primate lineages in Old and New World monkeys (OWMs and NWMs) and hominoids. Methodology/Principal Findings: To build a preferred model for the natural history of ADH1s, we determined the sequences of nine new ADH1 genes, finding for the first time multiple paralogs in various prosimians (lemurs, strepsirhines). Database mining then identified novel ADH1 paralogs in both macaque (an OWM) and marmoset (a NWM). These were used with the previously identified human paralogs to resolve controversies relating to dates of duplication and gene conversion in the ADH1 family. Central to these controversies are differences in the topologies of trees generated from exonic (coding) sequences and intronic sequences. Conclusions/Significance: We provide evidence that gene conversions are the primary source of difference, using molecular clock dating of duplications and analyses of microinsertions and deletions (micro-indels). The tree topology inferred from intron sequences appear to more correctly represent the natural history of ADH1s, with the ADH1 paralogs in platyrrhines (NWMs) and catarrhines (OWMs and hominoids) having arisen by duplications shortly predating the divergence of OWMs and NWMs. We also conclude that paralogs in lemurs arose independently. Finally, we identify errors in database interpretation as the source of controversies concerning gene conversion. These analyses provide a model for the natural history of ADH1s that posits four ADH1 paralogs in the ancestor of Catarrhine and Platyrrhine primates, followed by the loss of an ADH1 paralog in the human lineage.

J	Drogosz, A				Drogosz, Anna			Conceptualization of the Gene in Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene	ACADEMIC JOURNAL OF MODERN PHILOLOGY			English	Article						personification; blending; selfish gene; metaphor in science		This paper investigates the conceptualization of the gene in the book The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins from the point of view of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the Conceptual Blending Theory. It is argued that there are two senses of the gene: gene(1) is a physically existing section of the DNA, gene(2) is information about protein synthesis. It is the second sense of the concept of the gene that undergoes metaphorization. The analysis reveals that Dawkins' gene is a conceptual blend which becomes extensively elaborated. Through elaboration the gene becomes personified on the one hand and deified on the other. The study shows the richness of Dawkins' personification: the gene is conceptualized as building and controlling organisms, cooperating and competing with other genes, even showing personality traits. Deification of the gene is focused on highlighting its stipulated immortality and power to create organisms, humans included. The gene blend is at the same time used as an input space in the integration network producing the meme blend. It is also established that the personification of the gene plays the theory-constitutive role in the sense of Boyd (1993).

Gene therapy provides large opportunities for treating diseases, including genetic disorders, infections, and cancer. Polymeric carriers have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. Polymeric gene carriers are a potential substitute to using viral vectors. Overall, polymeric carriers can contain large-sized DNA, be conjugated with suitable functionalities, and be administered frequently. However, polymeric gene carriers have some restrictions, such as low gene transfection efficiencies and a moderately short period of gene expression. This study explores the current status of development of polymeric gene carriers, and presents guidelines for the prospective use of the polymer-based gene delivery systems in gene therapy.

Gene therapy is recognized to be a novel method for the treatment of cervical cancer. Genes can be administered into target cells via nanocarriers. This study aimed to develop systemically administrable nano-vectors. Floate (Fa) containing gene loaded nanoparticles (NPs) could target HeLa human cervical cancer cells through combination with receptors on the cells to increase the nuclear uptake of genetic materials. Methods: Fa was linked onto Poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (D,L-lactide) (PEG-PLA) to form Fa-PEG-PLA, and the resulting material was used to load plasmids of enhanced green fluorescence protein (pEGFP) to obtain gene loaded nanoparticles (Fa-NPs/DNA). Physical-chemical characteristics, in vitro release and cytotoxicity of Fa-NPs/DNA were evaluated. The in vitro transfection efficiency of Fa-NPs/DNA was evaluated in HeLa cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). PEG-PLA without Fa was used to load pEGFP from NPs/DNA as a control. Results: Fa-NPs/DNA has a particle size of 183 nm and a gene loading quantity of 92%. After 72h of transfection, Fa-NPs/DNA displayed over 20% higher transfection efficiency than NPs/DNA and 40% higher than naked DNA in HeLa cells. However, in HUVECs, no significant difference appeared between Fa-NPs/DNA and NPs/DNA. Conclusions: Fa-PEG-PLA NPs could function as excellent materials for gene loading. This nano-approach could be used as tumor cell targeted medicine for the treatment of cervical cancer.

The inference of such networks is often accomplished through the use of gene expression data. Many methods have been developed to evaluate gene expression dependencies between transcription factor and its target genes, and some methods also eliminate transitive interactions. The regulatory (or edge) direction is undetermined if the target gene is also a transcription factor. Some methods predict the regulatory directions in the gene regulatory networks by locating the eQTL single nucleotide polymorphism, or by observing the gene expression changes when knocking out/down the candidate transcript factors; regrettably, these additional data are usually unavailable, especially for the samples deriving from human tissues. Results: In this study, we propose the Context Based Dependency Network (CBDN), a method that is able to infer gene regulatory networks with the regulatory directions from gene expression data only. To determine the regulatory direction, CBDN computes the influence of source to target by evaluating the magnitude changes of expression dependencies between the target gene and the others with conditioning on the source gene. CBDN extends the data processing inequality by involving the dependency direction to distinguish between direct and transitive relationship between genes. We also define two types of important regulators which can influence a majority of the genes in the network directly or indirectly. CBDN can detect both of these two types of important regulators by averaging the influence functions of candidate regulator to the other genes. In our experiments with simulated and real data, even with the regulatory direction taken into account, CBDN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for inferring gene regulatory network. CBDN identifies the important regulators in the predicted network: 1. TYROBP influences a batch of genes that are related to Alzheimer's disease; 2. ZNF329 and RB1 significantly regulate those 'mesenchymal' gene expression signature genes for brain tumors. Conclusion: By merely leveraging gene expression data, CBDN can efficiently infer the existence of gene-gene interactions as well as their regulatory directions. The constructed networks are helpful in the identification of important regulators for complex diseases.

J	Choi, J; Park, T				Choi, Jiin; Park, Taesung			Multivariate generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to detect gene-gene interactions	BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW)	DEC 16-18, 2013	Singapore, SINGAPORE				GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION; COMPLEX DISEASES; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES; KOREAN POPULATION; LONGITUDINAL DATA; STRATEGIES; MODELS	Background: Recently, one of the greatest challenges in genome-wide association studies is to detect gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions for common complex human diseases. Ritchie et al. (2001) proposed multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method for interaction analysis. MDR is a combinatorial approach to reduce multi-locus genotypes into high-risk and low-risk groups. Although MDR has been widely used for case-control studies with binary phenotypes, several extensions have been proposed. One of these methods, a generalized MDR (GMDR) proposed by Lou et al. (2007), allows adjusting for covariates and applying to both dichotomous and continuous phenotypes. GMDR uses the residual score of a generalized linear model of phenotypes to assign either high-risk or low-risk group, while MDR uses the ratio of cases to controls. Methods: In this study, we propose multivariate GMDR, an extension of GMDR for multivariate phenotypes. Jointly analysing correlated multivariate phenotypes may have more power to detect susceptible genes and gene-gene interactions. We construct generalized estimating equations (GEE) with multivariate phenotypes to extend generalized linear models. Using the score vectors from GEE we discriminate high-risk from low-risk groups. We applied the multivariate GMDR method to the blood pressure data of the 7,546 subjects from the Korean Association Resource study: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We compare the results of multivariate GMDR for SBP and DBP to the results from separate univariate GMDR for SBP and DBP, respectively. We also applied the multivariate GMDR method to the repeatedly measured hypertension status from 5,466 subjects and compared its result with those of univariate GMDR at each time point. Results: Results from the univariate GMDR and multivariate GMDR in two-locus model with both blood pressures and hypertension phenotypes indicate best combinations of SNPs whose interaction has significant association with risk for high blood pressures or hypertension. Although the test balanced accuracy (BA) of multivariate analysis was not always greater than that of univariate analysis, the multivariate BAs were more stable with smaller standard deviations. Conclusions: In this study, we have developed multivariate GMDR method using GEE approach. It is useful to use multivariate GMDR with correlated multiple phenotypes of interests.

In order to incorporate prior biological knowledge such as pathways and protein interactions in the analysis of GWAS data it is necessary to derive one measure of association for each gene. We compare three different methods to obtain gene-wide test statistics from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) based association data: choosing the test statistic from the most significant SNP; the mean test statistics of all SNPs; and the mean of the top quartile of all test statistics. We demonstrate that the gene-wide test statistics can be controlled for the number of SNPs within each gene and show that all three methods perform considerably better than expected by chance at identifying genes with confirmed associations. By applying each method to GWAS data for Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes we identified new potential disease genes.

Multiple genes and polymorphisms have been found to be associated with variation in human pigmentation. Their analysis enables prediction of blue and brown eye colour with a reasonably high accuracy. More accurate prediction, especially in the case of intermediate eye colours, may require better understanding of gene-gene interactions affecting this polygenic trait. Using multifactor dimensionality reduction and logistic regression methods, a study of gene-gene interactions was conducted based on variation in 11 known pigmentation genes examined in a cohort of 718 individuals of European descent. The study revealed significant interactions of a redundant character between the HERC2 and OCA2 genes affecting determination of hazel eye colour and between HERC2 and SLC24A4 affecting determination of blue eye colour. Our research indicates interactive effects of a synergistic character between HERC2 and OCA2, and also provides evidence for a novel strong synergistic interaction between HERC2 and TYRP1, both affecting determination of green eye colour.

J	Landhuis, E				Landhuis, Esther			The Gene Fix	NATURE			English	Article; Early Access								THREE DECADES AFTER ITS FIRST, faltering steps in humans, gene therapy is emerging as a treatment option for a small but growing number of diseases. Although the concept faced scientific and ethical uncertainty when it was floated in the 1970s, the foundation of the ap-proach-replacing or fixing a single, disease-causing gene-has proved solid. Researchers have developed different ways to correct or influence the way someone's genes function and used those techniques to create therapies for several blood disorders, as well as degenerative eye and muscle diseases. More than half a dozen such treatments have gained approval in the U.S. in the past five years, and numerous others, aimed at a variety of conditions, are progressing toward clinical trials.										0	0	0	6	6	NATURE PORTFOLIO	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY	0028-0836	1476-4687		NATURE	Nature												10.1038/d41586-021-02736-8		OCT 2021	5	Multidisciplinary Sciences	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Science & Technology - Other Topics	WM8EL	WOS:000711312200003	34703017				2022-03-28

The purposes of this article are to summarize the basic concept and the strategies of reporter imaging; introduce reporter genes frequently used in optical imaging, nuclear medicine, and MRI for in vivo application; and show typical examples of reporter gene imaging. CONCLUSION. In molecular biology, many reporter genes have been developed for monitoring cellular processes. Development of controlled gene delivery systems promotes construction of various types of reporter genes for monitoring the level of a gene expression, promoter activity, and protein-protein interaction. When an imaging reporter gene is placed under the control of a promoter, the amount of reporter protein can be dynamically visualized in vivo. Instrumental advances in molecular imaging have increased the sensitivity and resolution of in vivo reporter imaging. Though several types of reporters and multimodal imaging instruments are currently available, more efficient multimodal reporter gene systems and detectors compatible with several imaging modalities are needed.

Mechanisms generating new gene families include de novo gene birth, horizontal gene transfer, and neofunctionalization following a duplication event. The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is a ubiquitous mutualism and the association has evolved repeatedly and independently many times among the fungi, but the evolutionary dynamics enabling its emergence remain elusive. We developed a phylogenetic workflow to first understand if gene families unique to ECM Amanita fungi and absent from closely related asym biotic species are functionally relevant to the symbiosis, and then to systematically infer their origins. We identified 109 gene families unique to ECM Amanita species. Genes belonging to unique gene families are under strong purifying selection and are upregulated during symbiosis, compared with genes of conserved or orphan gene families. The origins of seven of the unique gene families are strongly supported as either de novo gene birth (two gene families), horizontal gene transfer (four), or gene duplication (one). An additional 34 families appear new because of their selective retention within symbiotic species. Among the 109 unique gene families, the most upregulated gene in symbiotic cultures encodes a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, an enzyme capable of downregulating the synthesis of the plant hormone ethylene, a common negative regulator of plant-microbial mutualisms.

Subsequently, eukaryote evolution has been marked by episodes of gene transfer, mainly from the mitochondria to the nucleus, resulting in a significant reduction of the mitochondrial genome, eventually completely disappearing in some lineages. However, in other lineages such as in land plants, a high variability in gene repertoire distribution, including genes encoded in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome, is an indication of an ongoing process of Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT). Understanding how both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have been shaped by gene loss, duplication and transfer is expected to shed light on a number of open questions regarding the evolution of eukaryotes, including rooting of the eukaryotic tree. Results: We address the problem of inferring the evolution of a gene family through duplication, loss and EGT events, the latter considered as a special case of horizontal gene transfer occurring between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of the same species (in one direction or the other). We consider both EGT events resulting in maintaining (EGTcopy) or removing (EGTcut) the gene copy in the source genome. We present a linear-time algorithm for computing the DLE (Duplication, Loss and EGT) distance, as well as an optimal reconciled tree, for the unitary cost, and a dynamic programming algorithm allowing to output all optimal reconciliations for an arbitrary cost of operations. We illustrate the application of our EndoRex software and analyze different costs settings parameters on a plant dataset and discuss the resulting reconciled trees.

J	Willis, S; Masel, J				Willis, Sara; Masel, Joanna			Gene Birth Contributes to Structural Disorder Encoded by Overlapping Genes	GENETICS			English	Article						overprinting; gene age; alternative reading frame; evolutionary constraint; mutation-driven evolution	DE-NOVO; READING FRAMES; CODON USAGE; EVOLUTION; PROTEINS; VIRUS; ADAPTATION	The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.

An automated microfluidic gene-editing platform for deciphering cancer genes	LAB ON A CHIP			English	Article							DIGITAL MICROFLUIDICS; CELL-CULTURE; CRISPR-CAS9 SYSTEM; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; PLURONIC ADDITIVES; DRUG-SENSITIVITY; TUMOR-GROWTH; GENOME; DELIVERY; SPECIFICITY	Gene-editing techniques such as RNA-guided endonuclease systems are becoming increasingly popular for phenotypic screening. Such screens are normally conducted in arrayed or pooled formats. There has been considerable interest in recent years to find new technological methods for conducting these gene-editing assays. We report here the first digital microfluidic method that can automate arrayed gene-editing in mammalian cells. Specifically, this method was useful in culturing lung cancer cells for up to six days, as well as implementing automated gene transfection and knockout procedures. in addition, a standardized imaging pipeline to analyse fluorescently labelled cells was also designed and implemented during these procedures. A gene editing assay for interrogating the MAPK/ERK pathway was performed to show the utility of our platform and to determine the effects of knocking out the RAF1 gene in lung cancer cells. In addition to gene knockout, we also treated the cells with an inhibitor, Sorafenib Tosylate, to determine the effects of enzymatic inhibition. The combination of enzymatic inhibition and guide targeting on device resulted in lower drug concentrations for achieving half-inhibitory effects (IC50) compared to cells treated only with the inhibitor, confirming that lung cancer cells are being successfully edited on the device. We propose that this system will be useful for other types of gene-editing assays and applications related to personalized medicine.	[Sinha, Hugo; Vo, Philippe Q. N.; Shih, Steve C.

Pharmacogenomics of Hypertension and Preeclampsia: Focus on Gene-Gene Interactions	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						antihypertensive therapy; gene-gene interactions; epistasis; hypertension; pathways; pharmacogenomics; preeclampsia	ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPY; HAPLOTYPES; DISORDERS; PREGNANCY; ENOS; ENALAPRIL; RESPONSIVENESS; POLYMORPHISMS; EPISTASIS; GENOTYPES	Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, but only about half of patients on antihypertensive therapy achieve blood pressure control. Preeclampsia is defined as pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria, and is associated with increased maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Similarly, a large number of patients with preeclampsia are non-responsive to antihypertensive therapy. Pharmacogenomics may help to guide the personalized treatment for non-responsive hypertensive patients. There is evidence for the association of genetic variants with variable response to the most commonly used antihypertensive drugs. However, further replication is needed to confirm these associations in different populations. The failure to replicate findings from single-locus association studies has prompted the search for novel statistical methods for data analysis, which are required to detect the complex effects from multiple genes to drug response phenotypes. Notably, genegene interaction analyses have been applied to pharmacogenetic studies, including antihypertensive drug response. In this perspective article, we present advances of considering the interactions among genetic polymorphisms of different candidate genes within pathways relevant to antihypertensive drug response, and we highlight recent findings related to gene-gene interactions on pharmacogenetics of hypertension and preeclampsia. Finally, we discuss the future directions that are needed to unravel additional genes and variants involved in the responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs.

J	Lee, W; Sjolander, A; Pawitan, Y				Lee, Woojoo; Sjolander, Arvid; Pawitan, Yudi			A Critical Look at Entropy-Based Gene-Gene Interaction Measures	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						entropy; gene-gene interaction; specificity	COMPLEX DISEASES; ASSOCIATION	Several entropy-based measures for detecting gene-gene interaction have been proposed recently. It has been argued that the entropy-based measures are preferred because entropy can better capture the nonlinear relationships between genotypes and traits, so they can be useful to detect gene-gene interactions for complex diseases. These suggested measures look reasonable at intuitive level, but so far there has been no detailed characterization of the interactions captured by them. Here we study analytically the properties of some entropy-based measures for detecting gene-gene interactions in detail. The relationship between interactions captured by the entropy-based measures and those of logistic regression models is clarified. In general we find that the entropy-based measures can suffer from a lack of specificity in terms of target parameters, i.e., they can detect uninteresting signals as interactions. Numerical studies are carried out to confirm theoretical findings.

J	Harikrishnan, SL; Pucholt, P; Berlin, S				Harikrishnan, Srilakshmy L.; Pucholt, Pascal; Berlin, Sofia			Sequence and gene expression evolution of paralogous genes in willows	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								Whole genome duplications (WGD) have had strong impacts on species diversification by triggering evolutionary novelties, however, relatively little is known about the balance between gene loss and forces involved in the retention of duplicated genes originating from a WGD. We analyzed putative Salicoid duplicates in willows, originating from the Salicoid WGD, which took place more than 45 Mya. Contigs were constructed by de novo assembly of RNA-seq data derived from leaves and roots from two genotypes. Among the 48,508 contigs, 3,778 pairs were, based on fourfold synonymous third-codon transversion rates and syntenic positions, predicted to be Salicoid duplicates. Both copies were in most cases expressed in both tissues and 74% were significantly differentially expressed. Mean Ka/Ks was 0.23, suggesting that the Salicoid duplicates are evolving by purifying selection. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses showed that functions related to DNA-and nucleic acid binding were over-represented among the non-differentially expressed Salicoid duplicates, while functions related to biosynthesis and metabolism were over-represented among the differentially expressed Salicoid duplicates. We propose that the differentially expressed Salicoid duplicates are regulatory neo- and/or subfunctionalized, while the non-differentially expressed are dose sensitive, hence, functionally conserved. Multiple evolutionary processes, thus drive the retention of Salicoid duplicates in willows.

Gene expression of beta carotene genes in transgenic biofortified cassava	3 BIOTECH			English	Article						Confined field trial; Beta carotene genes; Gene expression; Patatin promoter; RT-PCR		Cassava is an important food for millions of people around the world. However, cassava is deficient in protein, iron, zinc, pro-vitamin A and vitamin E. Cassava biofortified with pro-vitamin A can help reduce Vitamin A Deficiency among the undernourished communities that rely upon it for sustenance. BioCassava Plus project has developed transgenic cassava that expresses beta carotene in roots using root specific patatin promoter. This study aimed at confirming expression of nptII, crtB and DXS genes. Leaf and roots samples were obtained from confined field trial at KARI Alupe at 12 months after planting. RNA was isolated from cassava roots and leaves using a modified Dellaporta protocol, analyzed for expression of DXS, crtB and the selectable marker, nptII using the one step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and analyzed through gel electrophoresis. DXS, crtB and nptII genes were expressed in the roots as anticipated. On the contrary, DXS and crtB genes were also expressed in the leaves of the transgenic cassava despite the use of root specific patatin promoter. This finding indicates that the promoter confers expression in leaves too. Intensive molecular screening of the biofortified transgenic cassava is important for risk assessment that informs on integrity of the promoter gene and confirms expression of the beta carotene genes.

J	Hejblum, BP; Skinner, J; Thiebaut, R				Hejblum, Boris P.; Skinner, Jason; Thiebaut, Rodolphe			Time-Course Gene Set Analysis for Longitudinal Gene Expression Data	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							COURSE MICROARRAY EXPERIMENTS; MIXED EFFECTS MODEL; PROFILES; PATHWAYS; TUBERCULOSIS; EXPLORATION; IMMUNITY; BIOLOGY; TESTS; TOOL	Gene set analysis methods, which consider predefined groups of genes in the analysis of genomic data, have been successfully applied for analyzing gene expression data in cross-sectional studies. The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) introduced here is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates. It allows to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When biological conditions are compared, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. The interest of the method is illustrated by its application to two real life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial), and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis corrected for multiple testing as well as a standard a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series both failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. When applied to the second illustrative data set, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets finally found to be linked with the influenza vaccine too although they were found to be associated to the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses. In our simulation study TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is made available for the community through an R package.

J	Paul, S; Maji, P				Paul, Sushmita; Maji, Pradipta			Gene ontology based quantitative index to select functionally diverse genes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Gene selection; Gene ontology; Functional diversity; Rough sets	BREAST-CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; PREDICTION	Among the large number of gene selection algorithms available in literature, the rough set based maximum relevance-maximum significance (RSMRMS) algorithm has been shown to be successful for selecting a set of relevant and significant genes from microarray data. However, the analysis of functional diversity of a gene set is essential to understand the role of genes in a particular disease as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of a gene selection algorithm. In this regard, a gene ontology based quantitative index, termed as degree of functional diversity (DoFD), is proposed to quantify the functional diversity of a set of genes selected by any gene selection algorithm. Moreover, a new gene selection algorithm is presented, integrating judiciously the merits of both DoFD and RSMRMS, to select relevant and significant genes those are also functionally diverse. The performance of the proposed gene selection algorithm, along with a comparison with other gene selection methods, is studied using the proposed DoFD and predictive accuracy of K-nearest neighbor rule and support vector machine on six cancer and one arthritis microarray data sets. An important finding is that the proposed gene ontology based quantitative index can accurately evaluate functional diversity of a set of genes. Also, the proposed gene selection algorithm is shown to be effective for selecting relevant, significant, and functionally diverse genes from microarray data.

Migration can introduce orders of magnitude more deleterious alleles per generation and may therefore be an important force acting on the structure of genomes. Using formal analytical methods, we study the invasion of haplotypes containing two copies of the resident allele, assuming that a single-locus equilibrium is already established in a continent-island model of migration. Provided that the immigrant allele can be completely masked by multiple functional gene copies, a new duplication will deterministically spread so long as duplicate haplotypes are, on average, fitter than single-copy haplotypes. When fitness depends on the number of immigrant allele copies and their masking ability then the threshold for invasion depends on the rate of immigration and the rate of recombination between the gene copies. Results from several special cases, including formation of protein dimers and DobzhanskyMuller incompatibilities, suggest that duplications can invade in a wide range of selection regimes. We hypothesize that duplication in response to gene flow may provide an explanation for the high levels of polymorphism in gene copy number observed in natural populations.

J	de Andrade, M; Wang, X				de Andrade, Mariza; Wang, Xin			Entropy Based Genetic Association Tests and Gene-Gene Interaction Tests	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Renyi entropy; genetic association; gene-gene interaction		In the past few years, several entropy-based tests have been proposed for testing either single SNP association or gene-gene interaction. These tests are mainly based on Shannon entropy and have higher statistical power when compared to standard chi 2 tests. In this paper, we extend some of these tests using a more generalized entropy definition, Renyi entropy, where Shannon entropy is a special case of order 1. The order lambda (>0) of Renyi entropy weights the events (genotype/haplotype) according to their probabilities (frequencies). Higher lambda places more emphasis on higher probability events while smaller lambda (close to 0) tends to assign weights more equally. Thus, by properly choosing the lambda, one can potentially increase the power of the tests or the p-value level of significance. We conducted simulation as well as real data analyses to assess the impact of the order lambda and the performance of these generalized tests. The results showed that for dominant model the order 2 test was more powerful and for multiplicative model the order 1 or 2 had similar power. The analyses indicate that the choice of lambda depends on the underlying genetic model and Shannon entropy is not necessarily the most powerful entropy measure for constructing genetic association or interaction tests.

These tasks are characterized by a large number of features and a few observations, making the modeling a nontrivial undertaking. In this study, we apply entropic filter methods for gene selection, in combination with several off-the-shelf classifiers. The introduction of bootstrap resampling techniques permits the achievement of more stable performance estimates. Our findings show that the proposed methodology permits a drastic reduction in dimension, offering attractive solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and number of explanatory genes; a dimensionality reduction technique preserving discrimination capabilities is used for visualization of the selected genes.

However, this is exactly the kind of scheme we propose for how Darwinian evolution could have occurred prior to template replication. Results: We cannot confirm previous claims that autocatalytic sets of organic polymer molecules could undergo evolution in any interesting sense by themselves. While we and others have previously imagined inhibition would result in selectability, we found that it produced multiple attractors in an autocatalytic set that cannot be selected for. Instead, we discovered that if general conditions are satisfied, the accumulation of adaptations in chemical reaction networks can occur. These conditions are the existence of rare reactions producing viable cores (analogous to a genotype), that sustains a molecular periphery (analogous to a phenotype). Conclusions: We conclude that only when a chemical reaction network consists of many such viable cores, can it be evolvable. When many cores are enclosed in a compartment there is competition between cores within the same compartment, and when there are many compartments, there is between-compartment competition due to the phenotypic effects of cores and their periphery at the compartment level. Acquisition of cores by rare chemical events, and loss of cores at division, allows macromutation, limited heredity and selectability, thus explaining how a poor man's natural selection could have operated prior to genetic templates. This is the only demonstration to date of a mechanism by which pre-template accumulation of adaptation could occur. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by William Martin and Eugene Koonin.

The availability of complete nucleotide sequences for an increasing number of rhabdoviruses has revealed that their ecological diversity is reflected in the diversity and complexity of their genomes. The five canonical rhabdovirus structural protein genes (N, P, M, G and L) that are shared by all rhabdoviruses are overprinted, overlapped and interspersed with a multitude of novel and diverse accessory genes. Although not essential for replication in cell culture, several of these genes have been shown to have roles associated with pathogenesis and apoptosis in animals, and cell-to-cell movement in plants. Others appear to be secreted or have the characteristics of membrane-anchored glycoproteins or viroporins. However, most encode proteins of unknown function that are unrelated to any other known proteins. Understanding the roles of these accessory genes and the strategies by which rhabdoviruses use them to engage, divert and re-direct cellular processes will not only present opportunities to develop new antiviral therapies but may also reveal aspects of cellar function that have broader significance in biology, agriculture and medicine.

Most studies of zic genes have been conducted in model systems that are members of the bilaterian phylum. However, two additional phyla have zic homologs encoded in their genomes. The three animal phyla that contain zic homologs all share a common ancestor and collectively are termed the parahoxozoans (cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish), placozoans (Trichoplax adhaerens), and bilaterians (chordates, insects, nematodes, annelids, echinoderms, etc.). In this chapter we briefly discuss our understanding of zic genes in the parahoxozoans with a particular focus on how expression of cnidarian zic homologs in the medusozoan Hydra vulgaris and the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis informs our understanding of the putative ancestral roles zic homologs played in the cnidarian-bilaterian common ancestor.

J	Jarvela, AMC; Trelstad, CS; Pick, L				Cheatle Jarvela, Alys M.; Trelstad, Catherine S.; Pick, Leslie			Regulatory gene function handoff allows essential gene loss in mosquitoes	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SHORT-GERM INSECT; PAIR-RULE; DROSOPHILA EMBRYOS; SPATIAL EXPRESSION; SEGMENTATION; EVOLUTION; PROTEINS; ANOPHELES; PATTERN; IDENTIFICATION	Regulatory genes are often multifunctional and constrained, which results in evolutionary conservation. It is difficult to understand how a regulatory gene could be lost from one species' genome when it is essential for viability in closely related species. The genepairedis a classicDrosophilapair-rule gene, required for formation of alternate body segments in diverse insect species. Surprisingly,pairedwas lost in mosquitoes without disrupting body patterning. Here, we demonstrate that apairedfamily member,gooseberry, has acquiredpaired-like expression in the malaria mosquitoAnopheles stephensi.Anopheles-gooseberryCRISPR-Cas9 knock-out mutants display pair-rule phenotypes and alteration of target gene expression similar to what is seen inDrosophilaand beetlepairedmutants. Thus,pairedwas functionally replaced by the related gene,gooseberry, in mosquitoes. Our findings document a rare example of a functional replacement of an essential regulatory gene and provide a mechanistic explanation of how such loss can occur. Cheatle Jarvela et al. demonstrate in the mosquitoAnopheles stephensithat thepairedgene was functionally replaced by the genegooseberry, even thoughpairedis essential in other insects such as fruit flies and beetles. This study contributes to the understanding of how essential genes are lost despite their importance during development.

Gene therapy has been used with success in patients suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes (X-SCID and ADA-deficiency), Leber's congenital amaurosis, hemophilia, beta-thalassemia and adrenoleukodystrophy. Last year, the first therapeutic vector (Glybera) for treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency has been registered in the European Union. Nevertheless, there are still several numerous issues that need to be improved to make this technique more safe, effective and easily accessible for patients. Introduction of the therapeutic gene to the given cells should provide the level of expression which will restore the production of therapeutic protein to normal values or will provide therapeutic efficacy despite not fully physiological expression. However, in numerous diseases the expression of therapeutic genes has to be kept at certain level for some time, and then might be required to be switched off to be activated again when worsening of the symptoms may aggravate the risk of disease relapse. In such cases the promoters which are regulated by local conditions may be more required. In this article the special emphasis is to discuss the strategies of regulation of gene expression by endogenous stimuli. Particularly, the hypoxia- or miRNA-regulated vectors offer the possibilities of tight but, at the same time, condition-dependent and cell-specific expression. Such means have been already tested in certain pathophysiological conditions. This creates the chance for the translational approaches required for development of effective treatments of so far incurable diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Performing and interpreting these studies is not straightforward because the selection of candidates influences the interpretation of the results. As an example, Nicolaou et al. (Small Bus Econ 36:151-155, 2011) report a significant association between a common genetic variant in the DRD3 gene and the tendency to be an entrepreneur. We fail to replicate this finding using a much larger, independent dataset. In addition, we discuss the candidate gene approach and give suggestions to avoid the publication of false positives.

Due to the continuous increase of data deposited in genomic repositories, their content revision and analysis is recommended. Using GeneBase, a software with a graphical interface able to import and elaborate National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database entries, we provide tabulated spreadsheets updated to 2019 about human nuclear protein-coding gene data set ready to be used for any type of analysis about genes, transcripts and gene organization.ResultsComparison with previous reports reveals substantial change in the number of known nuclear protein-coding genes (now 19,116), the protein-coding non-redundant transcriptome space [now 59,281,518 base pair (bp), 10.1% increase], the number of exons (now 562,164, 36.2% increase) due to a relevant increase of the RNA isoforms recorded. Other parameters such as gene, exon or intron mean and extreme length appear to have reached a stability that is unlikely to be substantially modified by human genome data updates, at least regarding protein-coding genes. Finally, we confirm that there are no human introns shorter than 30bp.

Speciation genes are more likely to have discordant gene trees	EVOLUTION LETTERS			English	Article						Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities; gene tree discordance; incomplete lineage sorting; reproductive isolation; speciation	DOBZHANSKY-MULLER INCOMPATIBILITIES; HYBRID INCOMPATIBILITY; MALE-STERILITY; SPECIES TREES; POPULATION-GENETICS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; DROSOPHILA-MAURITIANA; HOUSE MICE; EVOLUTION; MODEL	Speciation genes are responsible for reproductive isolation between species. By directly participating in the process of speciation, the genealogies of isolating loci have been thought to more faithfully represent species trees. The unique properties of speciation genes may provide valuable evolutionary insights and help determine the true history of species divergence. Here, we formally analyze whether genealogies from loci participating in Dobzhansky-Muller (DM) incompatibilities are more likely to be concordant with the species tree under incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Individual loci differ stochastically from the true history of divergence with a predictable frequency due to ILS, and these expectations-combined with the DM model of intrinsic reproductive isolation from epistatic interactions-can be used to examine the probability of concordance at isolating loci. Contrary to existing verbal models, we find that reproductively isolating loci that follow the DM model are often more likely to have discordant gene trees. These results are dependent on the pattern of isolation observed between three species, the time between speciation events, and the time since the last speciation event. Results supporting a higher probability of discordance are found for both derived- derived and derived-ancestral DM pairs, and regardless of whether incompatibilities are allowed or prohibited from segregating in the same population. Our overall results suggest that DM loci are unlikely to be especially useful for reconstructing species relationships, even in the presence of gene flow between incipient species, and may in fact be positively misleading.

T-Box Genes and Developmental Gene Regulatory Networks in Ascidians	T-BOX GENES IN DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE	Current Topics in Developmental Biology		English	Review; Book Chapter							CIONA-INTESTINALIS EMBRYOS; MUSCLE-CELL DIFFERENTIATION; TRUNK LATERAL CELLS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; BRACHYURY GENE; HALOCYNTHIA-RORETZI; NOTOCHORD SPECIFICATION; EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS; CHORDATE DEVELOPMENT; MOLGULA-TECTIFORMIS	Ascidians are invertebrate chordates with a biphasic life cycle characterized by a dual body plan that displays simplified versions of chordate structures, such as a premetamorphic 40-cell notochord topped by a dorsal nerve cord and post-metamorphic pharyngeal slits. These relatively simple chordates are characterized by rapid development, compact genomes and ease of transgenesis, and thus provide the opportunity to rapidly characterize the genomic organization, developmental function, and transcriptional regulation of evolutionarily conserved gene families. This review summarizes the current knowledge on members of the T-box family of transcription factors in Ciona and other ascidians. In both chordate and nonchordate animals, these genes control a variety of morphogenetic processes, and their mutations are responsible for malformations and developmental defects in organisms ranging from flies to humans. In ascidians, T-box transcription factors are required for the formation and specialization of essential structures, including notochord, muscle, heart, and differentiated neurons. In recent years, the experimental advantages offered by ascidian embryos have allowed the rapid accumulation of a wealth of information on the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of T-box genes. These studies have also elucidated the strategies employed by these transcription factors to orchestrate the appropriate spatial and temporal deployment of the numerous target genes that they control.

The use of the Gene Ontology is gradually affecting the way people store and understand bioinformatic data. To facilitate the prediction of gene functions with the aid of text mining methods and existing resources, we transform it into a multi-label top-down classification problem and develop a method that uses the hierarchical relationships in the Gene Ontology structure to relieve the quantitative imbalance of positive and negative training samples. Meanwhile the method enhances the discriminating ability of classifiers by retaining and highlighting the key training samples. Additionally, the top-down classifier based on a tree structure takes the relationship of target classes into consideration and thus solves the incompatibility between the classification results and the Gene Ontology structure. Our experiment on the Gene Ontology annotation corpus achieves an F-value performance of 50.7% (precision: 52.7% recall: 48.9%). The experimental results demonstrate that when the size of training set is small, it can be expanded via topological propagation of associated documents between the parent and child nodes in the tree structure. The top-down classification model applies to the set of texts in an ontology structure or with a hierarchical relationship.

They are also used for gene therapy and as vaccines to express foreign antigens. Adenovirus vectors can be replication-defective; certain essential viral genes are deleted and replaced by a cassette that expresses a foreign therapeutic gene. Such vectors are used for gene therapy, as vaccines, and for cancer therapy. Replication-competent (oncolytic) vectors are employed for cancer gene therapy. Oncolytic vectors are engineered to replicate preferentially in cancer cells and to destroy cancer cells through the natural process of lytic virus replication. Many clinical trials indicate that replication-defective and replication-competent adenovirus vectors are safe and have therapeutic activity.	[Wold, William S.

MLST revisited: the gene-by-gene approach to bacterial genomics	NATURE REVIEWS MICROBIOLOGY			English	Review							SEQUENCE TYPING SCHEME; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY; EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; TRANSMISSION; INSIGHTS; IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EMERGENCE	Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was proposed in 1998 as a portable sequence-based method for identifying clonal relationships among bacteria. Today, in the whole-genome era of microbiology, the need for systematic, standardized descriptions of bacterial genotypic variation remains a priority. Here, to meet this need, we draw on the successes of MLST and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to propose a hierarchical gene-by-gene approach that reflects functional and evolutionary relationships and catalogues bacteria 'from domain to strain'. Our gene-based typing approach using online platforms such as the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) allows the scalable organization and analysis of whole-genome sequence data.

These genes are also expressed in another set of embryonically derived mechanosensory neurons, the FLP neurons, but these cells do not share obvious TRN traits or proteins. We have identified similar to 300 genes in each cell type that are up-regulated at least threefold using DNA microarrays. Twenty-three percent of these genes are up-regulated in both cells. Surprisingly, some of the common genes had previously been identified as TRN-specific. Although the FLP neurons contain low amounts of the mRNAs for these TRN genes, they do not have detectable proteins. These results suggest that transcription control is relatively inexact but that these apparent errors of transcription are tolerated and do not alter cell fate. Previous studies showed that loss of the EGL44 and EGL-46 transcription factors cause the FLP neurons to acquire TRN-like traits. Here, we show that similar changes occur (e.g., the expression of both the TRN mRNAs and proteins) when the FLP neurons ectopically express the auxiliary transcription factor ALR-1 (Aristaless related), which ensures, but does not direct, TRN differentiation. Thus, the FLP neurons can acquire a TRN-like fate but use multiple levels of regulation to ensure they do not. Our data indicate that expression of common master regulators in different cell types can result in inappropriate expression of effector genes. This misexpression makes these cells vulnerable to influences that could cause them to acquire alternative fates.

Among the aims of such studies are testing developmental hypotheses and models of the etiology of behavioral disorders, defining boundaries of genetic and environmental influences, and identifying individuals most susceptible to risk exposures or most amenable to preventive and therapeutic interventions. This research also coincides with the emergence of unanticipated difficulties in detecting genetic variants of direct association with behavioral traits and disorders, which may be obscured if genetic effects are expressed only in predisposing environments. In this essay we consider these and other rationales for positing GxE interactions, review conceptual models meant to inform GxE interpretations from a psychological perspective, discuss points of common critique to which GxE research is vulnerable, and address the role of the environment in GxE interactions.

An efficient methodology for discovering both of gene-environment interactions and gene-gene interactions causing genetic diseases	EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Genetic diseases; Feature selection methods; Relief algorithm; Genetic algorithm; Classification decision tree	EXPRESSION; ALGORITHM	Genetic diseases are one of the most critical diseases facing human societies, their risk lies in the transmission of genetic characteristics from one generation to another, where the imbalance of these characteristics leads to an unhealthy offspring, which negatively affects the effort of this offspring and its services to society. Genetic disease is caused by a mutation in the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), these genetic mutations are generated by nonlinear interactions between two or more genes and / or environmental exposures. The aim of this paper is to discover both of gene-environment interactions and gene-gene interactions causing a genetic disease, the proposed methodology is based on both of the filter and wrapper feature selection methods, it uses the filter method using a Relief algorithm to detect the gene-environment interactions, wrapper method using genetic algorithm to discover gene-gene interactions, and classification decision tree algorithm to generate the conditional rules of gene-gene interactions. It has been evaluated using many different classifier models on four benchmark databases, and compared its performance with an Apriori algorithm for generating rules of gene-gene interactions, the proposed methodology achieved the highest performance and better classification accuracy on all databases containing patients affected by gene-environment interactions or gene-gene interactions or both of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.

We borrow ideas from the classical two-way analysis of variance literature to address the issue of robust modeling of interactions in repeated-measures studies. While classical interaction models proposed by Tukey and Mandel have interaction structures as a function of main effects, a newer class of models, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) models, do not have similar restrictive assumptions on the interaction structure. AMMI entails a singular value decomposition of the cell residual matrix after fitting the additive main effects and has been shown to perform well across various interaction structures. We consider these models for testing GGI and GEI from two perspectives: likelihood ratio test based on cell means and a regression-based approach using individual observations. Simulation results indicate that both approaches for AMMI models lead to valid tests in terms of maintaining the type I error rate, with the regression approach having better power properties. The performance of these models was evaluated across different interaction structures and 12 common epistasis patterns. In summary, AMMI model is robust with respect to misspecified interaction structure and is a useful screening tool for interaction even in the absence of main effects. We use the proposed methods to examine the interplay between the hemochromatosis gene and cumulative lead exposure on pulse pressure in the Normative Aging Study.

Determining gene-gene interactions (GGI) are one possible avenue for addressing the missing heritability problem. While many statistical approaches have been proposed to detect GGI, most of these focus primarily on SNP-to-SNP interactions. While there are many advantages of gene-based GGI analyses, such as reducing the burden of multiple-testing correction, and increasing power by aggregating multiple causal signals across SNPs in specific genes, only a few methods are available. In this study, we proposed a new statistical approach for gene-based GGI analysis, "Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of Gene-Gene Interactions" (HisCoM-GGI). HisCoM-GGI is based on generalized structured component analysis, and can consider hierarchical structural relationships between genes and SNPs. For a pair of genes, HisCoM-GGI first effectively summarizes all possible pairwise SNP-SNP interactions into a latent variable, from which it then performs GGI analysis. HisCoM-GGI can evaluate both gene-level and SNP-level interactions. Through simulation studies, HisCoM-GGI demonstrated higher statistical power than existing gene-based GGI methods, in analyzing a GWAS of a Korean population for identifying GGI associated with body mass index. Resultantly, HisCoM-GGI successfully identified 14 potential GGI, two of which, (NCOR2 x SPOCK1) and (LINGO2 x ZNF385D) were successfully replicated in independent datasets. We conclude that HisCoM-GGI method may be a valuable tool for genome to identify GGI in missing heritability, allowing us to better understand the biological genetic mechanisms of complex traits.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on CRC have successfully revealed common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CRC risk. However, they can only explain a very limited fraction of the disease heritability. One reason may be the common uni-variable analyses in GWAS where genetic variants are examined one at a time. Given the complexity of cancers, the non-additive interaction effects among multiple genetic variants have a potential of explaining the missing heritability. In this stud we employed two powerful ensemble learning algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting machine (GBM), to search for SNPs that contribute to the disease risk through non-additive gene-gene interactions. We were able to find 44 possible susceptibility SNPs that were ranked most significant by both algorithms. Out of those 44 SNPs, 29 are in coding regions. The 29 genes include ARRDC5, DCC, ALK, and ITGA1, which have been found previously associated with CRC, and E2F3 and NID2, which are potentially related to CRC since they have known associations with other types of cancer. We performed pairwise and three-way interaction analysis on the 44 SNPs using information theoretical techniques and found 17 pairwise (p < 0.02) and 16 three-way (p <= 0.001) interactions among them. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggested 16 functional terms or biological pathways that may help us better understand the etiology of the disease.

J	Jiang, R				Jiang, Rui			Walking on multiple disease-gene networks to prioritize candidate genes	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						disease-gene network; gene prioritization; random walk; data fusion	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; INTERACTOME; PHENOME; TEXT; TOOL; ASSOCIATION; MUTATIONS; INFERENCE; ONTOLOGY	Uncovering causal genes for human inherited diseases, as the primary step toward understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases, requires a combined analysis of genetic and genomic data. Although bioinformatics methods have been designed to prioritize candidate genes resulting from genetic linkage analysis or association studies, the coverage of both diseases and genes in existing methods is quite limited, thereby preventing the scan of causal genes for a significant proportion of diseases at the whole-genome level. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method named pgWalk to prioritize candidate genes by integrating multiple phenomic and genomic data. We derive three types of phenotype similarities among 7719 diseases and nine types of functional similarities among 20327 genes. Based on a pair of phenotype and gene similarities, we construct a disease-gene network and then simulate the process that a random walker wanders on such a heterogeneous network to quantify the strength of association between a candidate gene and a query disease. A weighted version of the Fisher's method with dependent correction is adopted to integrate 27 scores obtained in this way, and a final q-value is calibrated for prioritizing candidate genes. A series of validation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of this approach. We further show the effectiveness of this method in exome sequencing studies of autism and epileptic encephalopathies.

We adjusted P-values for multiple correlated tests, and used a Bonferroni-corrected alpha-level of 5 x 10(-4) to determine system-wide significance. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs12021667, rs12027267, rs6702335, rs12039988; r(2) > 0.98) in erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 (EPB41) had a significant male-specific marginal association with smoking abstinence (odds ratio (OR) = 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3-0.6) at end of treatment (adjusted P < 6 x 10(-5)). rs806365 in cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) had a significant male-specific gene-treatment interaction at 6-month follow-up (adjusted P = 3.9 x 10(-5)); within males using nasal spray, rs806365 was associated with a decrease in odds of abstinence (OR = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01-0.2). While the role of CNR1 in substance abuse has been well studied, we report EPB41 for the first time in the nicotine literature.

DNA delivery has been also suggested to improve reproductive outcomes for women with deficiencies in the female reproductive tract. Although no product has reached clinical phase, preclinical investigations reveal the potential of the vaginal tract as an effective administration route for gene delivery. This review focuses on the main advantages and challenges of vaginal gene therapy, and on the most used nucleic acid delivery systems, including viral and non-viral vectors. Additionally, the advances in the application of vaginal gene therapy for the treatment and/or prevention of infectious diseases such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the human papillomavirus (HPV) or the herpes simplex virus (HSV) are presented.

These mistakes are mostly due to an overlap in gene aliases, whereby two distinct genes share a pseudonym. This is particularly confusing when the gene products have also biological properties in common, are part of signaling pathways that cross-talk to one another, or are regulated by the same effectors. We present examples spanning several research fields including apoptosis, ubiquitin-dependent degradation, signaling by Notch, Wnt, and small G proteins, transporters of glutathione conjugates of electrophiles, and mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA genes. To solve the problem, we argue in favor of including Entrez gene numbers in papers submitted for publication as unique gene identifiers to allow precise identification of genes and species studied.

Three SNPs were selected for genotyping in the case-control study: rs4810485, rs763361, and rs3765456. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between SNP within CD40 and CD226 and SLE. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the interaction among three SNPs. Logistic regression analysis showed that SLE risk was significantly higher in carriers of T allele of rs4810485 in CD40 gene than those with GG genotype (GT+ TT vs GG), adjusted OR (95 % CI) 1.84 (1.40-2.29). In addition, we also found SLE risk was also significantly higher in carriers of rs763361 T allele within CD226 gene than those with CC genotype (CT+ TT vs CC), adjusted OR (95 % CI) 1.89 (1.38-2.13). GMDR analysis suggested a potential gene-gene interaction between rs4810485 and rs763361. Overall, cross-validation consistency of the two-locus model was 10/10, and the testing accuracy was 62.17 %. We also found that subjects with GT or TT of rs4810485 and CT or TT of rs763361 genotype have the highest SLE risk, compared with subjects with GG of rs4810485 and CC of rs763361 genotype, and OR (95 % CI) was 2.14 (1.67-3.08), after covariates adjustment. Our results support an important association of rs4810485 in CD40 gene and rs763361 in CD226 gene polymorphism, combined effect of rs4810485 and rs763361 with increased risk of SLE.

The fusion protein (FOXO1-PAX3/7) retains both binding domains and becomes a novel and potent transcriptional regulator in rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. Many studies have characterized and integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic differences among rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes that contain the FOXO1-PAX3/7 gene fusion and those that do not; however, few investigations have investigated how gene co-expression networks are altered by FOXO1-PAX3/7. Although transcriptional data offer insight into one level of functional regulation, gene co-expression networks have the potential to identify biological interactions and pathways that underpin oncogenesis and tumorigenicity. Thus, we examined gene co-expression networks for rhabdomyosarcoma that were FOXO1-PAX3 positive, FOXO1-PAX7 positive, or fusion negative. Gene co-expression networks were mined using local maximum Quasi-Clique Merger (lmQCM) and analyzed for co-expression differences among rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. This analysis observed 41 co-expression modules that were shared between fusion negative and positive samples, of which 17/41 showed significant up- or down-regulation in respect to fusion status. Fusion positive and negative rhabdomyosarcoma showed differing modularity of co-expression networks with fusion negative (n = 109) having significantly more individual modules than fusion positive (n = 53). Subsequent analysis of gene co-expression networks for PAX3 and PAX7 type fusions observed 17/53 were differentially expressed between the two subtypes. Gene list enrichment analysis found that gene ontology terms were poorly matched with biological processes and molecular function for most co-expression modules identified in this study; however, co-expressed modules were frequently localized to cytobands on chromosomes 8 and 11.

TOX encodes a nuclear protein of the high-mobility group box superfamily. It contains a DNA-binding domain, which allows it to regulate transcription by modifying local chromatin structure and modulating the formation of multi-protein complexes. Previous studies have shown that TOX play important roles in immune system. More recently, several studies have described TOX expression is frequently upregulated in diverse types of human tumors and the overregulation often associates with tumor progression. Moreover, TOXis involved in the control of cell apoptosis, growth, metastasis, DNA repair and so on. In this review, we provide an overview of current knowledge concerning the role of TOX in tumor development and progression biology function. To our knowledge, this is the first review about the role of thisnew oncogene in tumor development and progression.

In order to identify differentially expressed genes among various RNA-seq datasets obtained from different experimental designs, an appropriate normalization method for calibrating multiple experimental datasets is the first challenging problem. We propose a novel method to facilitate biologists in selecting a set of suitable housekeeping genes for inter-sample normalization. The approach is achieved by adopting user defined experimentally related keywords, GO annotations, GO term distance matrices, orthologous housekeeping gene candidates, and stability ranking of housekeeping genes. By identifying the most distanced GO terms from query keywords and selecting housekeeping gene candidates with low coefficients of variation among different spatio-temporal datasets, the proposed method can automatically enumerate a set of functionally irrelevant housekeeping genes for pratical normalization. Novel and benchmark testing RNA-seq datasets were applied to demostrate that different selections of housekeeping gene lead to strong impact on differential gene expression analysis, and compared results have shown that our proposed method outperformed other traditional approaches in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. The proposed mechanism of selecting appropriate houskeeping genes for inter-dataset normalization is robust and accurate for differential expression analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This gene plays a range of essential functions to ensure the cell cycle control, in addition to playing a central role in carcinogenesis. With respect to neoplasias, it prevents the neoplastic transformation through three intricate mechanisms. Depending on the extent of the mutation, different responses may be sent by p53 and those range since the disruption of the cell cycle, the correction of the mutation through the activation of repair proteins or still, the induction of senescence or cell death by apoptosis. This review aims to address the structural and functional aspects of the p53 gene and protein, and also reaffirm their participation in the carcinogenesis control, approaching their major mutations and the anticancer gene therapy involving this gene.

J	Rapp, JP				Rapp, John P.			Theoretical model for gene-gene, gene-environment, and gene-sex interactions based on congenic-strain analysis of blood pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive rats	PHYSIOLOGICAL GENOMICS			English	Article						epistasis; QTL; quantitative trait loci; genetic hypertension; salt-sensitive hypertension	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; HYPERTENSIVE-RAT; CANDIDATE GENE; RENAL-DISEASE; BROWN-NORWAY; QTL; EPISTASIS; GENOME; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IDENTIFICATION	There is a significant literature describing quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling blood pressure (BP) in the Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rat. In studies to identify the genes underlying BP QTL it has been common practice to place chromosomal segments from low BP strains on the genetic background of the S rat and then reduce the congenic segments by substitution mapping. The present work suggests a model to simulate genetic interactions found using such congenic strains. The QTL are considered to be switches that can be either in series or in parallel represented by the logic operators AND or OR, respectively. The QTL switches can be on/off switches but are also allowed specific leak properties. The QTL switches are represented by a "universal" switch consisting of two molecules binding to form a complex. Genetic inputs enter the model as allelic products of one of the binding molecules and environmental variation (including dietary salt-and sex-related differences) enters as an influence on the concentration of the other binding molecule. The pairwise interactions of QTL are very well simulated and fall into recognizable patterns. There is, however, often more than one assumed model to predict a given pattern so that all patterns do not necessarily have a unique solution. Nevertheless, the models obtained provide a framework for placing the QTL in pathways relative to one another. Moreover, based on their leak properties pairs of QTL could be identified in which one QTL may alter the properties of the other QTL.

H. Flor in mid of the 20th century set a milestone in understanding the biochemical and genetic basis of plant diseases and several components involved in plant-pathogen interactions. It highlighted the importance of accomplishing differential sets and understanding the pathogen population structure, it further led to the identification and cloning of several resistance (R) genes in plants. These R genes have been deployed and altered for fighting against diseases in a large number of crops using various conventional approaches and biotechnological tools. Identification of R genes and their corresponding Avr genes in many cases played a significant role in understanding of R-Avr gene interactions. Rapid cloning of R genes and editing of susceptible R genes are the other avenues that have broadened the horizon of utilizing R genes in crop improvement programmes. Further, combining R genes with quantitative disease resistance genes has paved the way to develop durable resistance in cultivars. The recent advances in genetics, genomics, bioinformatics and other OMICS tools are now providing greater prospects for deeper understanding of host-pathogen interaction.

J	Wang, JH; Chen, YH				Wang, Jie-Huei; Chen, Yi-Hau			Overlapping group screening for detection of gene-gene interactions: application to gene expression profiles with survival trait	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Gene-gene interaction; Lasso; Overlapping group; Survival prediction	ASSOCIATION; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; SELECTION; MODELS; SNP	Background: The development of a disease is a complex process that may result from joint effects of multiple genes. In this article, we propose the overlapping group screening (OGS) approach to determining active genes and gene-gene interactions incorporating prior pathway information. The OGS method is developed to overcome the challenges in genome-wide data analysis that the number of the genes and gene-gene interactions is far greater than the sample size, and the pathways generally overlap with one another. The OGS method is further proposed for patients' survival prediction based on gene expression data. Results: Simulation studies demonstrate that the performance of the OGS approach in identifying the true main and interaction effects is good and the survival prediction accuracy of OGS with the Lasso penalty is better than the ordinary Lasso method. In real data analysis, we identify several significant genes and/or epistasis interactions that are associated with clinical survival outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by utilizing prior pathway information from the KEGG pathway and the GO biological process databases, respectively. Conclusions: The OGS approach is useful for selecting important genes and epistasis interactions in the ultra-high dimensional feature space. The prediction ability of OGS with the Lasso penalty is better than existing methods. The OGS approach is generally applicable to various types of outcome data (quantitative, qualitative, censored event time data) and regression models (e.g. linear, logistic, and Cox's regression models).

This genetic variation causes considerable functional differences. We examined the patterns of expression of invertase (Inv) gene families and an invertase inhibitor (INH) gene involved in elongating roots, hypocotyls, and fruit of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Micro-Tom and L. chmielewskii) through a real-time quantitative PCR analysis. We found that the Lin6 gene plays an important role in the vegetative growth stage. Lin5 and Lin7 did not express in Micro-Tom, but did express in L. chmielewskii. Overall relative expression levels of sucrose Inv gene families were significantly lower in L. chmielewskii during the reproductive growth stage than in Micro-Tom, being up to hundreds of times lower. It was not expressed in the dissepiment in L. chmielewskii. We suggest that differences in sucrose accumulation in tomato fruit is mainly due to differentially expressed invertase gene families at the later fruit growth stages.	[Zhang, Y. L.; Zhang, A.

However, their impact on discrimination and risk prediction is limited. It has been suggested that the identification of gene-gene (G-G) and gene-environment (G-E) interactions would improve disease prediction and facilitate prevention. We conducted a simulation study to explore the potential improvement in discrimination if G-G and G-E interactions exist and are known. We used three diseases (breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis) as motivating examples. We show that the inclusion of G-G and G-E interaction effects in risk-prediction models is unlikely to dramatically improve the discrimination ability of these models.

Gene therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: Strategies to select therapeutic genes	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						gene therapy; rheumatoid arthritis; therapeutic genes; therapeutic strategies	COLLAGEN-INDUCED ARTHRITIS; NF-KAPPA-B; ABROGATES DISEASE-ACTIVITY; REACTIVE T-CELLS; ADENOVIRAL DELIVERY; IN-VIVO; MEDIATED OVEREXPRESSION; ANKYLOSING-SPONDYLITIS; SYNOVIAL FIBROBLASTS; REDUCES INFLAMMATION	Significant advances have been achieved in recent years to ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in animal models using gene therapy approaches rather than biological treatments. Although biological agents serve as antirheumatic drugs with suppressing proinflammatory cytokineactivities, they are usually accompanied by systemic immune suppression resulting from continuous or high systemic doseinjections of biological agents. Therefore, gene transfer approaches have opened an interesting perspective to deliver one or multiple genes in a target-specific or inducible manner for the sustained intra-articular expression of therapeutic products. Accordingly, many studies have focused on gene transferring methods in animal models by using one of the available approaches. In this study, the important strategies used to select effective genes for RA gene therapy have been outlined. Given the work done in this field, the future looks bright forgene therapy as a new method in the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases such as RA, and by ongoing efforts in this field, we hope to achieve feasible, safe, and effective treatment methods.

Autophagy is the process of degradation and recycling of damaged cytoplasmic organelles, macromolecular aggregates, and long-lived proteins. Malfunction of autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, and autophagy genes may modulate the T cell survival. We aimed to examine the expression levels of autophagy-related genes. The blood samples of 95 unrelated patients (aged 17-65 years, 37 male, 58 female) diagnosed as MS and 95 healthy controls were used to extract the RNA samples. After conversion to single stranded cDNA using polyT priming: the targeted genes were pre-amplified, and 96 x 78 (samples x primers) qRT-PCR reactions were performed for each primer pair on each sample on a 96.96 array of Fluidigm BioMark(TM). Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, gene expression levels of ATG16L2, ATG9A, BCL2, FAS, GAA, HGS, PIK3R1, RAB24, RGS19, ULK1, FOXO1, HTT were significantly altered (false discovery rate < 0.05). Thus, altered expression levels of several autophagy related genes may affect protein levels, which in turn would influence the activity of autophagy, or most probably, those genes might be acting independent of autophagy and contributing to MS pathogenesis as risk factors. The indeterminate genetic causes leading to alterations in gene expressions require further analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigating the Role of Gene-Gene Interactions in TB Susceptibility	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MISSING HERITABILITY; BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS; ASSOCIATION; EPISTASIS; TUBERCULOSIS; POLYMORPHISMS; POPULATION; STRATEGIES; VARIANTS; LOCI	Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of mortality from infectious disease worldwide. One of the factors involved in developing disease is the genetics of the host, yet the field of TB susceptibility genetics has not yielded the answers that were expected. A commonly posited explanation for the missing heritability of complex disease is gene-gene interactions, also referred to as epistasis. In this study we investigate the role of gene-gene interactions in genetic susceptibility to TB using a cohort recruited from a high TB incidence community from Cape Town, South Africa. Our discovery data set incorporates genotypes from a large a number of candidate gene studies as well as genome-wide data. After limiting our search space to pairs of putative TB susceptibility genes, as well as pairs of genes that have been curated in online databases as potential interactors, we use statistical modelling to identify pairs of interacting SNPs. We attempt to validate the top models identified in our discovery data set using an independent genome-wide TB case-control data set from The Gambia. A number of models were successfully validated, indicating that interplay between the NRG1-NRG3, GRIK1-GRIK3 and IL23R-ATG4C gene pairs may modify susceptibility to TB. Gene pairs involved in the NF-kappa B pathway were also identified in the discovery data set (SFTPD-NOD2, ISG15-TLR8 and NLRC5-IL12RB1), but could not be tested in the Gambian study group due to lack of overlapping data.

However, these susceptibility loci known today explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Gene-gene interaction (GxG) is considered to be one source of the missing heritability. To address this, we performed a genome-wide search for pair-wise GxG associated with CRC risk using 8,380 cases and 10,558 controls in the discovery phase and 2,527 cases and 2,658 controls in the replication phase. We developed a simple, but powerful method for testing interaction, which we term the Average Risk Due to Interaction (ARDI). With this method, we conducted a genome-wide search to identify SNPs showing evidence for GxG with previously identified CRC susceptibility loci from 14 independent regions. We also conducted a genome-wide search for GxG using the marginal association screening and examining interaction among SNPs that pass the screening threshold (p < 10(-4)). For the known locus rs10795668 (10p14), we found an interacting SNP rs367615 (5q21) with replication p = 0.01 and combined p = 4.19x10(-8). Among the top marginal SNPs after LD pruning (n = 163), we identified an interaction between rs1571218 (20p12.3) and rs10879357 (12q21.1) (nominal combined p = 2.51x10(-6); Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.03). Our study represents the first comprehensive search for GxG in CRC, and our results may provide new insight into the genetic etiology of CRC.

Emerging literature establishes MTA1 to be a valid DNA-damage responsive protein with a significant role in maintaining the optimum DNA-repair activity in mammalian cells exposed to genotoxic stress. This DNA-damage responsive function of MTA1 was reported to be a P53-dependent and independent function. Here, we investigate the influence of P53 on gene regulation function of Mta1 to identify novel gene targets and functions of Mta1. Methods: Gene expression analysis was performed on five different mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) samples (i) the Mta1 wild type, (ii) Mta1 knock out (iii) Mta1 knock out in which Mta1 was reintroduced (iv) P53 knock out (v) P53 knock out in which Mta1 was over expressed using Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Further Hierarchical Clustering, Gene Ontology analysis with GO terms satisfying corrected p-value, 0.1, and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were performed. Finally, RT-qPCR was carried out on selective candidate genes. Significance/Conclusion: This study represents a complete genome wide screen for possible target genes of a coregulator, Mta1. The comparative gene profiling of Mta1 wild type, Mta1 knockout and Mta1 re-expression in the Mta1 knockout conditions define "bona fide'' Mta1 target genes. Further extensive analyses of the data highlights the influence of P53 on Mta1 gene regulation. In the presence of P53 majority of the genes regulated by Mta1 are related to inflammatory and antimicrobial responses whereas in the absence of P53 the predominant target genes are involved in cancer signaling. Thus, the presented data emphasizes the known functions of Mta1 and serves as a rich resource which could help us identify novel Mta1 functions.

In this study we have tried to explain a genetic basis of a temperament inheritance mode; temperament is regularly inherited by the son from the mother and by the daughter from the father. Such a transmission mode corresponds to the X chromosome-linked inheritance and indicates that a temperament gene locus is on the X chromosome. Here we show that most probable temperament gene candidate is the VAMP7 gene of Xq PAR; besides its role in neuritogenesis, a relationship was proposed between the outward migration mode of the VAMP7 mediated vesicles, the female paternal temperament allele preservation in the secondary oocyte/ovum, and its transmission to the next generation. We have eliminated 113 temperament gene candidates in the distal Xq region, due to their mRNA numbers, expression in the brain and ovary, accordance to our proposed inheritance mode of a silent temperament allele, and genetic linkages.

Almost half of sarcomas show a simple genetic lesion which is specific for the diagnosis: recurrent translocations in 10 to 15% of sarcomas, specific activating and inactivating mutations in GIST and rhabdoid tumor respectively, and MDM2 amplification in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas as well as in intimal sarcoma. A recent study reported a gene expression signature which is much better than histological grading for predicting metastasis outcome. This signature is composed of 67 genes all belonging to pathways involved in chromosome integrity suggesting an important role of these mechanisms in the development of metastases. On the other hand, and except for GIST with KIT and PDGFRA mutations, there is no validated predictive gene signature so far.

Given that genetic networks are typically comprised of robust, co-evolved interactions, the emergence of new genes raises an intriguing question: how do new genes interact with pre-existing genes? Here, we show that a recently originated gene rapidly evolved new gene networks and impacted sex-biased gene expression in Drosophila. This 4-6 million-year-old factor, named Zeus for its role in male fecundity, originated through retroposition of a highly conserved housekeeping gene, Caf40. Zeus acquired male reproductive organ expression patterns and phenotypes. Comparative expression profiling of mutants and closely related species revealed that Zeus has recruited a new set of downstream genes, and shaped the evolution of gene expression in germline. Comparative ChIP-chip revealed that the genomic binding profile of Zeus diverged rapidly from Caf40. These data demonstrate, for the first time, how a new gene quickly evolved novel networks governing essential biological processes at the genomic level.

This infection is associated with several health consequences, including cervical and prostate cancers and HIV acquisition. Gene expression analysis has been facilitated because of available genome sequences and large-scale transcriptomes in T. vaginalis, particularly using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), one of the most used methods for molecular studies. Reference genes for normalization are crucial to ensure the accuracy of this method. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic validation of reference genes has not been performed for T. vaginalis. In this study, the transcripts of nine candidate reference genes were quantified using qRT-PCR under different cultivation conditions, and the stability of these genes was compared using the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The most stable reference genes were alpha-tubulin, actin and DNATopII, and, conversely, the widely used T. vaginalis reference genes GAPDH and beta-tubulin were less stable. The PFOR gene was used to validate the reliability of the use of these candidate reference genes. As expected, the PFOR gene was upregulated when the trophozoites were cultivated with ferrous ammonium sulfate when the DNATopII, alpha-tubulin and actin genes were used as normalizing gene. By contrast, the PFOR gene was downregulated when the GAPDH gene was used as an internal control, leading to misinterpretation of the data. These results provide an important starting point for reference gene selection and gene expression analysis with qRT-PCR studies of T. vaginalis.

Yet, here we are, at it again. Has there been any progress? I believe that there has been, and that among the many advances enabled by the genomics revolution, progress on species concepts and species recognition is among them.

Cochlear gene therapy has undergone tremendous advances over the past decade. Beginning with some groundbreaking work in 2005 documenting hair cell regeneration using virally mediated delivery of the mouse atonal 1 gene, gene therapy is now being explored as a possible treatment for a variety of causes of hearing loss. Recent findings Recent advances in cochlear gene therapy include improved methods of gene delivery with a better delineation of viral vectors that are suitable for this purpose, additional improvements in hair cell regeneration, and directed research toward autoimmune hearing loss, ototoxicity, spiral ganglion survival, and genetic forms of hearing loss. Summary If successful, cochlear gene therapy will dramatically alter our ability to treat a variety of forms of acquired and genetic hearing loss.

This study investigated whether polymorphisms in genes encoding glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), T1 (GSTT1), and P1 (GSTP1) jointly contribute to the risk of T2DM. MethodsIn all, 1120 unrelated Russian subjects (600 T2DM patients, 520 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects), were recruited to the study. Genotyping was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR; del/del polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1) and TaqMan-based PCR (polymorphisms I105V and A114V of GSTP1). Plasma ROS and glutathione levels in study subjects were analyzed by fluorometric and colorimetric assays, respectively. ResultsGenotype del/del GSTT1 was significantly associated with the risk of T2DM (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-2.21, P=0.003). Gender-stratified analysis showed that the deletion genotypes of GSTM1 (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.30-3.05; P=0.0002, Q=0.016) and GSTT1 (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.22-4.09; P=0.008, Q=0.0216), as well as genotype 114A/V of GSTP1 (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.44-5.62; P=0.005, Q=0.02) were associated with an increased risk of T2DM exclusively in males. Three genotype combinations (i.e. GSTM1+xGSTT1+, GSTM1+xGSTP1 114A/A and GSTT1+xGSTP1 114A/A) showed significant associations with a decreased risk of T2DM in males. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates, for the first time, that genes encoding glutathione S-transferases jointly contribute to the risk of T2DM, and that their effects on disease susceptibility are gender specific.

ReliefSeq: A Gene-Wise Adaptive-K Nearest-Neighbor Feature Selection Tool for Finding Gene-Gene Interactions and Main Effects in mRNA-Seq Gene Expression Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CANALIZATION; NETWORK	Relief-F is a nonparametric, nearest-neighbor machine learning method that has been successfully used to identify relevant variables that may interact in complex multivariate models to explain phenotypic variation. While several tools have been developed for assessing differential expression in sequence-based transcriptomics, the detection of statistical interactions between transcripts has received less attention in the area of RNA-seq analysis. We describe a new extension and assessment of Relief-F for feature selection in RNA-seq data. The ReliefSeq implementation adapts the number of nearest neighbors (k) for each gene to optimize the Relief-F test statistics (importance scores) for finding both main effects and interactions. We compare this gene-wise adaptive-k (gwak) Relief-F method with standard RNA-seq feature selection tools, such as DESeq and edgeR, and with the popular machine learning method Random Forests. We demonstrate performance on a panel of simulated data that have a range of distributional properties reflected in real mRNA-seq data including multiple transcripts with varying sizes of main effects and interaction effects. For simulated main effects, gwak-Relief-F feature selection performs comparably to standard tools DESeq and edgeR for ranking relevant transcripts. For gene-gene interactions, gwak-Relief-F outperforms all comparison methods at ranking relevant genes in all but the highest fold change/highest signal situations where it performs similarly. The gwak-Relief-F algorithm outperforms Random Forests for detecting relevant genes in all simulation experiments. In addition, Relief-F is comparable to the other methods based on computational time. We also apply ReliefSeq to an RNA-Seq study of smallpox vaccine to identify gene expression changes between vaccinia virus-stimulated and unstimulated samples. ReliefSeq is an attractive tool for inclusion in the suite of tools used for analysis of mRNA-Seq data; it has power to detect both main effects and interaction effects.

To clarify the effects of these polymorphisms on HCC risk, an updated meta-analysis of all available studies was conducted. Methods: Eligible articles were identified by search of databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM) for the period up to July 2013. Data were extracted by two independent authors and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Metaregression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Results: Finally, a total of 10 studies including 2,243 cases and 3,615 controls were available for MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and 14 studies containing 4,855 cases and 6,630 controls were included for TP53 R72P polymorphism. With respect to MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism, significantly increased HCC risk was found in the overall population. In subgroup analysis by ethnicity and hepatitis virus infection status, significantly increased HCC risk was found in Asians, Caucasians, Africans, and HCV positive patients. With respect to TP53 R72P polymorphism, no significant association with HCC risk was observed in the overall and subgroup analyses. In the MDM2 SNP309-TP53 R72P interaction analysis, we found that subjects with MDM2 309TT and TP53 Pro/Pro genotype, MDM2 309 TG and TP53 Arg/Pro genotype, and MDM2 309 GG and TP53 Pro/Pro genotype were associated with significantly increased risk of developing HCC as compared with the reference MDM2 309TT and TP53 Arg/Arg genotype. Conclusions: We concluded that MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. In addition, our findings further suggest that the combination of MDM2 SNP 309 and TP53 Arg72Pro genotypes confers higher risk to develop HCC. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.

We examined potential association of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the HA synthesizing gene - hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), hyaluronan binding protein 1 (HABP1) and HA catabolic gene hyaluronidase 3 (HYAL3) in the primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients in the Indian population. Thirteen tagged SNPs (6 for HAS2, 3 for HABP1 and 4 for HYAL3) were genotyped in 116 high tension (HTG), 321 non-high tension glaucoma (NHTG) samples and 96 unrelated, age-matched, glaucoma-negative, control samples. Allelic and genotypic association were analyzed by PLINK v1.04; haplotypes were identified using PHASE v2.1 and gene-gene interaction was analyzed using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) v2.0. An allelic association (rs6651224; p = 0.03; OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.25-0.94) was observed at the second intron (C>G) of HAS2 both for NHTG and HTG. rs1057308 revealed a genotypic association (p = 0.03) at the 5' UTR of HAS2 with only HTG. TCT haplotype (rs1805429 - rs2472614 - rs8072363) in HABP1 and TTAG and TTGA (rs2285044 - rs3774753 - rs1310073 - rs1076872) in HYAL3 were found to be significantly high (p < 0.05) both for HTG and NHTG compared to controls. Gene-gene interaction revealed HABP1 predominantly interacts with HAS2 in HTG while it associates with both HYAL3 and HAS2 in NHTG. This is the first genetic evidence, albeit from a smaller study, that the natural polymorphisms in the genes involved in hyaluronan metabolism are potentially involved in glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

Rapid genetic improvement in milk production traits in dairy cattle has been accompanied by decline in cow fertility. The genetic basis of this correlation remains poorly understood. Expanded reference populations and large sets of sequenced animals make genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with imputed markers possible for large populations and thereby studying genetic architecture of complex traits.ResultsIn this study, we associated 15,551,021 SNPs with female fertility index in 5038 Nordic Holstein cattle. We have identified seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) on six chromosomes in cattle. Along with nearest genes to GWAS hits, we used gene-based analysis and spread of linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to generate a list of potential candidate genes affecting fertility in cattle. Subsequently, we used prior knowledge on gene related to fertility from Gene Ontology terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, mammalian phenotype database, and public available RNA-seq data to refine the list of candidate genes for fertility. We used variant annotations to investigate candidate mutations within the prioritized candidate genes. Using multiple source of information, we proposed candidate genes with biological relevance underlying each of these seven QTL. On chromosome 1, we have identified ten candidate genes for two QTL. For the rest of chromosomes, we proposed one candidate gene for each QTL. In the candidate genes list, differentially expressed genes from different studies support FRAS1, ITGB5, ADCY5, and SEMA5B as candidate genes for cow fertility.ConclusionThe GWAS result not only confirmed previously mapped QTL, but also made new findings. Our findings contributes towards dissecting the genetics for female fertility in cattle. Moreover, this study shows the usefulness of adding independent information to pick candidate genes during post-GWAS analysis.

Evolutionary Signatures amongst Disease Genes Permit Novel Methods for Gene Prioritization and Construction of Informative Gene-Based Networks	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; ENDOTHELIN RECEPTOR-B; RATE COVARIATION; PROTEIN; MUTATIONS; PATHWAY; PREDICTION; VARIANTS; MEDICINE; DATABASE	Genes involved in the same function tend to have similar evolutionary histories, in that their rates of evolution covary over time. This coevolutionary signature, termed Evolutionary Rate Covariation (ERC), is calculated using only gene sequences from a set of closely related species and has demonstrated potential as a computational tool for inferring functional relationships between genes. To further define applications of ERC, we first established that roughly 55% of genetic diseases posses an ERC signature between their contributing genes. At a false discovery rate of 5% we report 40 such diseases including cancers, developmental disorders and mitochondrial diseases. Given these coevolutionary signatures between disease genes, we then assessed ERC's ability to prioritize known disease genes out of a list of unrelated candidates. We found that in the presence of an ERC signature, the true disease gene is effectively prioritized to the top 6% of candidates on average. We then apply this strategy to a melanoma-associated region on chromosome 1 and identify MCL1 as a potential causative gene. Furthermore, to gain global insight into disease mechanisms, we used ERC to predict molecular connections between 310 nominally distinct diseases. The resulting "disease map" network associates several diseases with related pathogenic mechanisms and unveils many novel relationships between clinically distinct diseases, such as between Hirschsprung's disease and melanoma. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of molecular evolution as a gene discovery platform and show that evolutionary signatures can be used to build informative gene-based networks.

The initial stage of infection involves attachment to plant tissues, and subsequently, biofilms may form at these sites. This study focuses on the periplasmic ExoR regulator, which was identified based on the severe biofilm deficiency of A. tumefaciens exoR mutants. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed to elucidate the complete ExoR regulon. Overproduction of the exopolysaccharide succinoglycan is a dramatic phenotype of exoR mutants. Comparative expression analyses revealed that the core ExoR regulon is unaffected by succinoglycan synthesis. Several findings are consistent with previous observations: genes involved in succinoglycan biosynthesis, motility, and type VI secretion are differentially expressed in the Delta exoR mutant. In addition, these studies revealed new functional categories regulated by ExoR, including genes related to virulence, conjugation of the pAtC58 megaplasmid, ABC transporters, and cell envelope architecture. To address how ExoR exerts a broad impact on gene expression from its periplasmic location, a genetic screen was performed to isolate suppressor mutants that mitigate the exoR motility phenotype and identify downstream components of the ExoR regulatory pathway. This suppression analysis identified the acid-sensing two-component system ChvG-ChvI, and the suppressor mutant phenotypes suggest that all or most of the characteristic exoR properties are mediated through ChvG-ChvI. Subsequent analysis indicates that exoR mutants are simulating a response to acidic conditions, even in neutral media. This work expands the model for ExoR regulation in A. tumefaciens and underscores the global role that this regulator plays on gene expression.

To investigate associations between total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from eight candidate genes (IL-4 rs2243250, IL-4R alpha rs1805010, IL-13 rs20541, IL-13R alpha 1 rs2495636, CD14 rs2569190, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) rs1800629, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA4) rs231775, FCER1B rs1441585) in children with asthma and to evaluate gene-gene interactions. Methods. A total of 669 Korean children with asthma (n = 544 atopic n = 125 non-atopic) were included. Asthma phenotypes, total serum IgE levels, and methacholine challenge test results were evaluated. SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method. Multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to analyze gene-gene interactions. Results. The combination of the IL-13, IL-13R alpha 1, and CTLA4 polymorphisms was selected through MDR analysis of the data pertaining to children with atopic and non-atopic asthma (accuracy = 0.5459, cross validation consistency (CVC) = 10/10). The IL-4R alpha, IL-13, IL-13R alpha 1, CD14, and CTLA4 polymorphisms were selected as the best model of increased total serum IgE levels in non-atopic and atopic asthma (asthma: accuracy = 0.4726, CVC = 10/10; atopic asthma: accuracy = 0.4573, CVC = 10/10). Both the IL-4R alpha and the IL-13 polymorphisms were correlated with the IgE level. ANOVA analysis revealed that the combinations of the CTLA4 and IL-13, IL-13 and IL-13R alpha 1, IL-4R alpha and IL-13, and CD14 and IL-13 polymorphisms were all significantly associated with increased total serum IgE levels. Conclusions. The best model of increased IgE level included the IL-4R alpha, IL-13, IL-13R alpha 1, CD14, and CTLA4 polymorphisms. Of the various interactions between these polymorphisms, the combinations of the CTLA4 and IL-13 polymorphisms and the IL-13 and IL-13R alpha 1 polymorphisms showed synergistic effects in terms of increased total serum IgE levels in the present cohort.

This study aimed to assess how the genetic interactions confer risk of stroke. Methods In a Chinese case-control study including 1,405 strokes and 1,263 controls who were followed up (range, 0.1-6.0 years), eight genes, including apolipoprotein(a) (APOA1), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP), NOTCH3, chromosome 9p21.3(Chr.9p21.3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), were analyzed for interactions by the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method and validated by the multivariate logistic regression models. The genetic associations with carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) were examined. Results The interaction of VKORC1 and Chr.9p21.3 was identified for stroke and its worse prognosis, and subjects having the VKORC1 rs2359612C and Chr.9p21.3 rs10757274G alleles had higher risks for stroke (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.32-2.52) as well as for stroke recurrence (HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.24-2.73), cardiovascular events (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.15-2.38), and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.24-3.79). Supporting, they were associated with higher IMT. Hypertension or physical inactivity increased the risk effect. The interaction of VEGFA rs833061C and KDR rs2305948T was identified for hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusions Our findings identified two novel genetic interactions of VKORC1 and Chr.9p21.3 and of VEGFA and KDR for risk of stroke and subtypes as well as future stroke prognosis.

However, this is not necessarily the case. To clarify this, we compared the differences between human housekeeping genes and essential human genes with respect to four aspects: the evolutionary rate (dN/dS), protein sequence identity, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and level of linkage disequilibrium (LD). The results showed that housekeeping genes had lower evolutionary rates, higher sequence identities, lower SNP densities and higher levels of LD compared with essential genes. Together, these findings indicate that housekeeping and essential genes are two distinct types of genes, and that housekeeping genes have a higher level of evolutionary conservation. Therefore, we suggest that researchers should pay careful attention to the distinctions between housekeeping genes and essential genes. Moreover, it is still controversial whether we should substitute human orthologs of mouse essential genes for human essential genes. Therefore, we compared the evolutionary features between human orthologs of mouse essential genes and human housekeeping genes and we got inconsistent results in long-term and short-term evolutionary characteristics implying the irrationality of simply replacing human essential genes with human orthologs of mouse essential genes.

The aims of this study were to explore the associations between antidepressant remission and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes, and gene-gene interactions in the Ras-Raf-MAPK intracellular signaling pathway. A total of 302 inpatients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV Axis I) were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale before and after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment to determine the remission rate in the samples. Twenty-four SNPs at five kinase genes (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-RSK), which are a part of the Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway, were identified to investigate a genetic association with antidepressant drug outcome. Correlations between 24 SNPs at the five kinase genes in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway and antidepressant drug outcome were not found. The percentage of the CCAGA haplotype that RSK(2/3/4)-RSKL(1/2) gene loci SNPs constructed was markedly lower in the remitter group when compared with the nonremitter group in female depressed patients (P=0.04), whereas the proportion of AAAGGG haplotype that RSK(2/3/4)-RSKL(1/2) gene loci SNPs constructed in the remitter group was significantly greater than that in the nonremitter group in male patients (P=0.02). In addition, MEK1 (rs28730804) and RSK3 (rs2229712) in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway showed a gene-gene interaction that affected antidepressant drug outcome in female depressed patients (P=0.041). Although this study did not find that SNPs at the five kinase genes in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway are important markers for antidepressant outcome, certain haplotypes that SNPs at the RSK(2/3/4)-RSKL(1/2) gene constructed may be important markers for antidepressant drug efficacy. We observed a gene-gene interaction in this signaling pathway that influenced antidepressant efficacy in female depressed patients. Therefore, it is likely that in female depressed patients, different haplotypes and gene-gene interaction in the Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway are involved in mediating the pharmacological action of an antidepressant, and eventually influence antidepressant efficacy.

To clarify these associations, a meta-analysis was conducted. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for all such manuscripts published as of May 1, 2017. The pooled odds ratio (ORs) with confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated for each study to assess the strength of the association. A subgroup analysis, a sensitivity analysis, and a publication bias analysis were also performed. Results: Data from 41 studies comprising 5291 EC cases and 8191 controls were available for analysis of the GSTM1 polymorphism, and data from 31 studies comprising 4330 EC cases and 6558 controls were available for analysis of the GSTT1 polymorphism. Analyses of the GSTM1 polymorphisms demonstrated that there was a significantly increased EC risk in GSTM1 null genotype carriers (OR=1.319, 95% CI=1.125-1.546, p for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analyses by ethnicity, and categories of EC, a significantly increased EC risk was found in Asians (OR=1.457, 95% CI=1.212-1.751, p for heterogeneity <0.001) and patients whose histological type was unknown. Analyses of the GSTT1 polymorphisms indicated a positive correlation between the GSTT1 null genotype and the EC risk (OR=1.233, 95% CI=1.044-1.455, p for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity and categories of EC, similar statistical association were observed in Asians, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, and ESCC on Asian population. In the GSTM1-GSTT1 interaction analysis, we discovered remarkably enhanced EC risk for patients with the GSTM1 and GSTT1 dual null genotypes (OR=1.962, 95% CI=1.178-3.268, p for heterogeneity <0.001) compared with the reference GSTM1 and GSTT1 dual positive genotype. Conclusions: We conclude that the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes denote increased genetic susceptibility to EC in the overall human population, particularly among Asians. In addition, our findings suggest that persons with a null genotype for both the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are at higher risk of developing EC. Further well-designed studies are needed to confirm these associations.

After the great success of large scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies using the high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips, the study of gene-gene interaction becomes a next challenge. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis has been widely used for the gene-gene interaction analysis. In practice, however, it is not easy to perform high order gene-gene interaction analyses via MDR in genome-wide level because it requires exploring a huge search space and suffers from a computational burden due to high dimensionality. Results: We propose dimensional reduction analysis, Gene-MDR analysis for the fast and efficient high order gene-gene interaction analysis. The proposed Gene-MDR method is composed of two-step applications of MDR: within- and between-gene MDR analyses. First, within-gene MDR analysis summarizes each gene effect via MDR analysis by combining multiple SNPs from the same gene. Second, between-gene MDR analysis then performs interaction analysis using the summarized gene effects from within-gene MDR analysis. We apply the Gene-MDR method to bipolar disorder (BD) GWA data from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). The results demonstrate that Gene-MDR is capable of detecting high order gene-gene interactions associated with BD. Conclusion: By reducing the dimension of genome-wide data from SNP level to gene level, Gene-MDR efficiently identifies high order gene-gene interactions. Therefore, Gene-MDR can provide the key to understand complex disease etiology.

Inflammatory conditions increase stroke risk, and the inflammatory response is of major importance in recovery and healing processes after stroke. We investigated the role of inflammatory genes IL1B, IL6, MPO, and TNF in stroke susceptibility and recovery in a population sample of 672 patients and 530 controls, adjusting for demographic, clinical and lifestyle risk factors, and stroke severity parameters. We also considered the likely complexity of inflammatory mechanisms in stroke, by assessing the combined effects of multiple genes. Two interleukin 6 (IL6) and one myeloperoxidase (MPO) single-nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with stroke risk (0.022 <(corrected)P < 0.042), highlighting gene variants of low to moderate effect in stroke risk. An epistatic interaction between the IL6 and MPO genes was also identified in association with stroke susceptibility (P = 0.031 after 1,000 permutations). In a subset of 546 patients, one IL6 haplotype was associated with stroke outcome at 3 months ((corrected)P = 0.024), an intriguing finding warranting further validation. Our findings support the association of the IL6 gene and present novel evidence for the involvement of MPO in stroke susceptibility, suggesting a modulation of stroke risk by main gene effects, clinical and lifestyle factors, and gene-gene interactions.

Selection of Fusarium Trichothecene Toxin Genes for Molecular Detection Depends on TRI Gene Cluster Organization and Gene Function	TOXINS			English	Review						Fusarium; molecular detection; mycotoxin; trichothecenes	NIVALENOL-PRODUCING CHEMOTYPES; DEOXYNIVALENOL PRODUCTION; BIOSYNTHESIS GENES; F-GRAMINEARUM; HEAD BLIGHT; TRICHODIENE SYNTHASE; PCR-DETECTION; WHEAT; MYCOTOXINS; CULMORUM	Food security is a global concern. Fusarium are among the most economically important fungal pathogens because they are ubiquitous, disease management remains a challenge, they produce mycotoxins that affect food and feed safety, and trichothecene mycotoxin production can increase the pathogenicity of some Fusarium species depending on the host species. Although trichothecenes may differ in structure by their patterns of hydroxylation or acetylation, these small changes have a significant impact on toxicity and the biological activity of these compounds. Therefore, detecting and identifying which chemotype is present in a given population are important to predicting the specific toxins that may be produced and, therefore, to evaluating the risk of exposure. Due to the challenges of inducing trichothecene production by Fusarium isolates in vitro for subsequent chemical analysis, PCR assays using gene-specific primers, either singly or in combination, designed against specific genes of the trichothecene gene cluster of multiple species of Fusarium have been developed. The establishment of TRI genotypes that potentially correspond to a specific chemotype requires examination of an information and knowledge pipeline whose critical aspects in sequential order are: (i) understanding the TRI gene cluster organization which differs according to Fusarium species under study; (ii) knowledge of the re-arrangements to the core TRI gene cluster over evolutionary time, which also differs according to Fusarium species; (iii) the functions of the TRI genes in the biosynthesis of trichothecene analogs; and (iv) based on (i)-(iii), selection of appropriate target TRI gene(s) for primer design in PCR amplification for the Fusarium species under study. This review, therefore, explains this pipeline and its connection to utilizing TRI genotypes as a possible proxy to chemotype designation.

The third one is the most general in dissecting the genetic mechanism underlying complex diseases underpinning multiple quantitative traits. In this paper, we developed a novel statistic for this strategy through modifying the Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLSPM), called mPLSPM statistic. Results: Simulation studies indicated that mPLSPM statistic was powerful and outperformed the principal component analysis (PCA) based linear regression method. Application to real data in the EPIC-Norfolk GWAS sub-cohort showed suggestive interaction (gamma) between TMEM18 gene and BDNF gene on two composite body shape scores (gamma = 0.047 and gamma = 0.058, with P = 0.021, P = 0.005), and BMI (gamma = 0.043, P = 0.034). This suggested these scores (synthetically latent traits) were more suitable to capture the obesity related genetic interaction effect between genes compared to single trait. Conclusions: The proposed novel mPLSPM statistic is a valid and powerful gene-based method for detecting gene-gene interaction on multiple quantitative phenotypes.

J	Pejaver, VR; Kim, S				Pejaver, Vikas Rao; Kim, Sun			Gene Cluster Profile Vectors: a method to infer functionally related gene sets by grouping proximity-based gene clusters	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine	DEC 18-21, 2010	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			GENOME; ANNOTATION	Background: Proximity-based methods and co-evolution-based phylogenetic profiles methods have been successfully used for the identification of functionally related genes. Proximity-based methods are effective for physically clustered genes while the phylogenetic profiles method is effective for co-occurring gene sets. However, both methods predict many false positives and false negatives. In this paper, we propose the Gene Cluster Profile Vector (GCPV) method, which combines these two methods by using phylogenetic profiles of whole gene clusters. The GCPV method is, currently, the only genome comparison based method that allows for the characterization of relationships between gene clusters based profiles of individual genes in clusters. Results: The GCPV method groups together reasonably related operons in E. coli about 60% of the time. The method is not sensitive to the choice of a reference genome set used and it outperforms the conventional phylogenetic profiles method. Finally, we show that the method works well for predicted gene clusters from C. crescentus and can serve as an important tool not only for understanding gene function, but also for elucidating mechanisms of general biological processes. Conclusions: The GCPV method has shown to be an effective and robust approach to the prediction of functionally related gene sets from proximity-based gene clusters or operons.

We analyzed 13 polymorphisms in the transporters, metabolizing enzymes, targets, and genes involved in DNA damage and the folate pathway among 132 patients treated with gemcitabine and studied their association with the severity of the hematological toxicities. Single-locus analysis showed that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) RRM1 rs12806698 and rs11031918 and DCTD rs7663494 were significantly associated with severe neutropenia, hENT1 rs760370 and hCNT3 rs7867504 and rs4877831 were associated with severe leukopenia, CDA rs2072671, DCTD rs7663494, and WEE1 rs3910384 were associated with severe anemia, and MTHFR rs1801133 was associated with severe thrombocytopenia after stringent Bonferroni correction (P < .0038). The gene-gene interaction analysis identified the overall best models, including a 2-way interaction model (hCNT3 rs7867504 and dCK rs12648166) for severe leukopenia (P = .0022) and a 3-locus model (CDA rs207671, DCTD rs7663494, and WEE1 rs3910384) for severe anemia with a strong synergistic effect (P = .0001). The association with hematological toxicity was further strengthened by the results of a haplotype analysis, in which the homozygous genotype combination of rs3910384 CC, rs2072671 AA, rs12648166 GG, rs7867504 CC, and rs7663494 TT conferred high genetic susceptibility to severe thrombocytopenia. Our results suggest that the gene-gene interaction of gemcitabine metabolic pathway genes and WEE1 contributes to susceptibility to gemcitabine-induced hematological toxicity. Moreover, we propose a promising data-mining analysis approach (generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction) to detect and characterize gene-gene interactions.

The core idea of the algorithm was to build a gene co-expression network (GCN) based on gene expression data firstly; Then the Newman algorithm was used to initially identify gene modules based on the topology of GCN, and the number of clusters and clustering centers were determined; Finally the number of clusters and clustering centers were input into the K-means algorithm framework, and the secondary clustering was performed based on the gene expression profile to obtain the final gene modules. The algorithm took into account the role of modularity in the clustering process, and could find the optimal membership module for each gene through multiple iterations. Experimental results showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper had the best performance in error rate, biological significance and CNN classification indicators (Precision, Recall and F-score). The gene module obtained by GCNA-Kpca was used for the task of key gene identification, and these key genes had the highest prognostic significance. Moreover, GCNA-Kpca algorithm was used to identify 10 key genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): CDC20, CCNB1, EIF4A3, H2AFX, NOP56, RFC4, NOP58, AURKA, PCNA, and FEN1. According to the validation, it was reasonable to speculate that these 10 key genes could be biomarkers for HCC. And NOP56 and NOP58 are key genes for HCC that we discovered for the first time.

The function of over a thousand genes is reported as affected by genetic modifications in breast cancer. Objectives: To study the gene expression of Epithelial Membrane 2 (EMP2) and beta 1-Integrin genes in patients with breast cancer. Subjects and methods: This study was carried out by cooperation between the Biochemistry Division Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University. This study included 120 subjects divided into 2 groups Group I: Included 60 women with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy. Tissue specimens were taken from the cancerous breast tissue and from the marginal healthy breast tissues. Group II: Included 60 age and sex-matched apparently healthy women served as a control group. All patients participants were subjected to full history taking, general clinical examination, abdominal ultrasound, CT-scan for abdomen, mammography, fine needle biopsy, histopathological examination, immunostaining of tissues, metastatic work up (chest x-ray and bone scan) and laboratory investigations including: Complete blood count (patients and controls), serum carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (patients and controls), detection of EMP2 and beta 1-Integrin genes expression in the tissue samples by formation of cDNA by reverse transcription PCR after RNA extraction and real-time PCR using SYBR Green technique. Results: Compared to healthy tissues, the breast cancer tissues had significant higher EMP2 and beta 1-Integringene expression levels. Also, there was a significant increase in CA15-3 in patients group as compared with the control group. It was found that EMP2 and beta 1-Integrin expression in malignant tissue samples correlates with advanced and metastatic disease. Conclusion: The gene expression of EMP2 and beta 1-Integrin are important markers for the severity of breast cancer and they are good indicators of its prognosis.

We have established an exchangeable gene trap system, in which a reporter gene can be exchanged for any other DNA of interest through Cre/mutant lox-mediated recombination. We isolated trap clones, analyzed trapped genes, and constructed the database for Exchangeable Gene Trap Clones (EGTC) []. The number of registered ES cell lines was 1162 on 31 August 2013. We also established 454 mouse lines from trap ES clones and deposited them in the mouse embryo bank at the Center for Animal Resources and Development, Kumamoto University, Japan. The EGTC database is the most extensive academic resource for gene-trap mouse lines. Because we used a promoter-trap strategy, all trapped genes were expressed in ES cells. To understand the general characteristics of the trapped genes in the EGTC library, we used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for pathway analysis and found that the EGTC ES clones covered a broad range of pathways. We also used Gene Ontology (GO) classification data provided by Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) to compare the functional distribution of genes in each GO term between trapped genes in the EGTC mouse lines and total genes annotated in MGI. We found the functional distributions for the trapped genes in the EGTC mouse lines and for the RefSeq genes for the whole mouse genome were similar, indicating that the EGTC mouse lines had trapped a wide range of mouse genes.

Available data also indicate that sex-specific genetic differences contribute to SLE susceptibility. The aim of this study was to test for gene-gene/gene-sex epistasis (interactions) in these known lupus susceptibility loci. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MiR146a, IRF5, IKZF1, ETS1 and IL21 were genotyped by Sequenom MassArray system. A total of 1,825 subjects (858 SLE patients and 967 controls) were included in the final analysis. Epistasis was tested by additive model, multiplicative model and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Additive interaction analysis revealed interactions between IRF5 and IKZF1 (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.48-3.44 [P = 1.21x10(4)]). A similar tendency was also observed between IL21 and ETS1 by parametric methods. In addition, multiple high dimensional gene-gene or gene-sex interactions (three-and four-way) were identified by MDR analysis. Our study identified novel gene-gene/gene-sex interactions in lupus. Furthermore, these findings highlight sex, interferon pathway, and Th17/B cells as important contributors to the pathogenesis of SLE.

However, both CLrenal and CLsec were increased for the volunteers with minor alleles in c.808 (G>T) who were also homozygous for the reference variant g.-66T>C: CLrenal: GG, GT, and TT: 28.1, 34.5, and 44.8 l/h (P=0.004), respectively and CLsec: GG, GT, and TT: 21.4, 27.8, and 37.6 l/h (P=0.005), respectively. In the volunteers with minor alleles in c.808 (G>T) who were also heterozygous for g.-66T>C, both CLrenal and CLsec were found to be reduced (P<0.028) when compared with volunteers with minor alleles in c.808 (G>T) carrying the g.-66T>C reference genotype.ConclusionWe report counteracting effects of the c.808 (G>T) and g.-66T>C on the renal elimination of metformin. When adjusted for the genetic variation g.-66T>C, our results suggest that c.808 (G>T) could have a dominant genotype to phenotype correlation.	[Christensen, Mette M.

Gene structure and spatiotemporal expression profile of tomato genes encoding YUCCA-like flavin monooxygenases: The ToFZY gene family	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Auxin; Flavin monooxygenase; FZY; Indole-3-acetic acid; IAA; ToFZY; Triptamine; YUCCA-like FMO	DEPENDENT AUXIN BIOSYNTHESIS; REAL-TIME PCR; FRUIT-DEVELOPMENT; ARABIDOPSIS; LEAF; TRYPTAMINE; ACID; QUANTIFICATION; ACCUMULATION; VALIDATION	The flavin monooxygenases (FMO) encoded by plant YUCCA genes are thought to catalyze a rate-limiting step in the tryptamine pathway for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis. Recent experiments with different plant models have indicate that YUCCA genes play essential roles in growth and development through their contribution to the local pool of free auxin. In this study we have characterized five new genes that encode YUCCA-like FMOs in the tomato genome (ToFZY2 to ToFZY6), including gene structure, conserved motifs and phylogenetic analyses. As a first step towards clarifying the individual functions of ToFZY genes, we have used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to conduct a systematic comparison of the steady-state mRNA levels of 6 ToFZY genes, in 33 samples representing major organs and the entire tomato life cycle. We followed an absolute quantification strategy which allowed us to cross-compare transcript levels among different ToFZY genes in a given spatiotemporal coordinate. Our results indicate that expression of ToFZY genes is temporally and spatially regulated, and that the distinctive expression pattern of each ToFZY gene partially overlaps with other members of the multigenic family. We compare our data with previous results in other plant species and make some predictions about the role of tryptamine pathway in tomato growth and development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is thus vital to understand the pathogenicity mechanisms and contributing to genes in C. glabrata. However, gene complementation as a tool for restoring the function of a previously deleted gene is not standardized in C. glabrata, and it is less frequently used than in C. albicans. In this study, we established a gene complementation strategy using genomic integration at the TRP1 locus. We prove that our approach can not only be used for integration of complementation cassettes, but also for overexpression of markers like fluorescent proteins and the antigen ovalbumin, or of potential pathogenicity-related factors like the biotin transporter gene VHT1. With urea amidolyase Dur1,2 as an example, we demonstrate the application of the gene complementation approach for the expression of sequence-modified genes. With this approach, we found that a lysine-to-arginine mutation in the biotinylation motif of Dur1,2 impairs urea-dependent growth of C. giabrata and C. aibicans. Taken together, the TRP1-based gene complementation approach is a valuable tool for investigating novel gene functions and for elucidating their role in the pathobiology of C. giabrata.

Thus, a meta-analysis was performed. Results: We identified 54 individual studies involving 9,322 cases and 15,118 controls through computer-based searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. It was found that the null genotype of GSTM1 was associated with an increased gastric cancer risk (OR = 1.207, 95% CI: 1.106-1.317, P < 0.001), under the random-effects model (I-2 : 49.9%, P-Q < 0.001). From stratification analyses for ethnicity, alcohol drinking, Helicobacter pylori infection, an effect modification of gastric cancer risk was found in the subgroups of ethnicity, smoking status, Helicobacter pylori infection, whereas null result was found in the subgroups of alcohol drinking. We also undertook gene-gene interaction analysis between GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes for gastric cancer risk, and the results indicated that the dual null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 might elevate the risk of gastric cancer (OR = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.165-1.944, P = 002). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the null genotype of GSTM1 may be a important genetic risk factor for gastric cancer development.

This process is supported by the development of new high-throughput technologies that enable better understanding of disease mechanism. It becomes critical to facilitate effective analysis of the large amount of biological data. However, with much of the biological knowledge represented in the literature in the form of natural text, analysis and interpretation of high-throughput data has not reached its potential effectiveness. In this paper, we describe our solution in employing text mining as a technique in finding scientific information for target and biomarker discovery from the biomedical literature. Our approach utilises natural language processing techniques to capture linguistic patterns for the extraction of biological knowledge from text. Additionally, we discuss how the extracted knowledge is used for the analysis of biological data such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression data.

Yet, such approaches are usually restricted by the high variation in expression profiles when primary specimens are analyzed. It is conceivable that with the assessment of the degree of coordination in gene expression as opposed to the magnitude of differential expression, we may obtain hints underscoring different biological and pathological states. Here we have analyzed a publicly available dataset related to frailty, a syndrome characterized by reduced responsiveness to stressors and exhibiting increased prevalence in the elderly. We evaluated the transcriptome that loses its coordination between the frailty and control groups and assessed the biological functions that are acquired in the former group. Among the top genes exhibiting the lowest correlation, at the whole transcriptome level, between the control and frailty groups were TSIX, BEST1 and ADAMTSL4. Processes related to immune response and regulation of cellular metabolism and the metabolism of macromolecules emerged in the frailty group. The proposed strategy confirms and extends earlier findings regarding the pathogenesis of frailty and provides a paradigm on how the diversity in expression profiles of primary specimens could be leveraged for target discovery.

TALE-encoding (tal) genes were thought to be absent from Brassicaceae-infecting Xanthomonas campestris (Xc) genomes based on four reference genomic sequences. We discovered tal genes in 26 of 49 Xc strains isolated worldwide and used a combination of single molecule real time (SMRT) and tal amplicon sequencing to yield a near-complete description of the TALEs found in Xc (Xc TALome). The 53 sequenced tal genes encode 21 distinct DNA binding domains that sort into seven major DNA binding specificities. In silico analysis of the Brassica rapa promoterome identified a repertoire of predicted TALE targets, five of which were experimentally validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The Xc TALome shows multiple signs of DNA rearrangements that probably drove its evolution from two ancestral tal genes. We discovered that Tal12a and Tal15a of Xcc strain Xca5 contribute together in the development of disease symptoms on susceptible B.oleracea var. botrytis cv Clovis. This large and polymorphic repertoire of TALEs opens novel perspectives for elucidating TALE-mediated susceptibility of Brassicaceae to black rot disease and for understanding the molecular processes underlying TALE evolution.

The comparison among experimental conditions are made using the posterior probability for hypothesis of equality or inequality. To calculate the posterior probabilities, we use the Polya urn scheme through latent variables and the Bayes factor. The performance of the proposed method, as well as a comparison with usual Tukey-test, are evaluated on artificial data and on a shotgun proteomics data set. The results reveal a better performance of the proposed methodology in identification of difference of means and/or variance.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon known to regulate DNA methylation of either maternal or paternal alleles. We hypothesize that hypermethylated endometriosis-associated genes may be enriched at imprinted gene loci. We sought to determine whether downregulated genes associated with endometriosis susceptibility are associated with chromosomal location of the known paternally and maternally expressed imprinting genes. Gene information has been gathered from National Center for Biotechnology Information database geneimprint.com. Several researchers have identified specific loci with strong DNA methylation in eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesion with endometriosis. Of the 29 hypermethylated genes in endometriosis, 19 genes were located near 45 known imprinted foci. There may be an association of the genomic location between genes specifically downregulated in endometriosis and epigenetically imprinted genes.

Several studies have indicated that the results from such methods are more reproducible and more easily interpretable than the results from single gene-based methods. A new method for ranking gene sets with respect to their association with a given predictor or response, using a new framework for robust gene list representation, is proposed. Employing the concept of exchangeability of random variables, this method attempts to account for the functional redundancy among the genes. Compared to other evaluated methods for gene set ranking, the proposed method yields rankings that are more robust with respect to sampling variations in the underlying data, which allows more reliable biological conclusions.

Finding the active genes in deep RNA-seq gene expression studies	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							QUANTIFICATION; TRANSCRIPTOME	Background: Early application of second-generation sequencing technologies to transcript quantitation (RNA-seq) has hinted at a vast mammalian transcriptome, including transcripts from nearly all known genes, which might be fully measured only by ultradeep sequencing. Subsequent studies suggested that low-abundance transcripts might be the result of technical or biological noise rather than active transcripts; moreover, most RNA-seq experiments did not provide enough read depth to generate high-confidence estimates of gene expression for low-abundance transcripts. As a result, the community adopted several heuristics for RNA-seq analysis, most notably an arbitrary expression threshold of 0.3 - 1 FPKM for downstream analysis. However, advances in RNA-seq library preparation, sequencing technology, and informatic analysis have addressed many of the systemic sources of uncertainty and undermined the assumptions that drove the adoption of these heuristics. We provide an updated view of the accuracy and efficiency of RNA-seq experiments, using genomic data from large-scale studies like the ENCODE project to provide orthogonal information against which to validate our conclusions. Results: We show that a human cell's transcriptome can be divided into active genes carrying out the work of the cell and other genes that are likely the by-products of biological or experimental noise. We use ENCODE data on chromatin state to show that ultralow-expression genes are predominantly associated with repressed chromatin; we provide a novel normalization metric, zFPKM, that identifies the threshold between active and background gene expression; and we show that this threshold is robust to experimental and analytical variations. Conclusions: The zFPKM normalization method accurately separates the biologically relevant genes in a cell, which are associated with active promoters, from the ultralow-expression noisy genes that have repressed promoters. A read depth of twenty to thirty million mapped reads allows high-confidence quantitation of genes expressed at this threshold, providing important guidance for the design of RNA-seq studies of gene expression. Moreover, we offer an example for using extensive ENCODE chromatin state information to validate RNA-seq analysis pipelines.

We here show from analytical and numerical analysis that the distance between a transcription factor (TF) gene and its target gene drastically affects the speed and reliability of transcriptional regulation in bacterial cells. For an explicit model system, we develop a general theory for the interactions between a TF and a transcription unit. The observed variations in regulation efficiency are linked to the magnitude of the variation of the TF concentration peaks as a function of the binding site distance from the signal source. Our results support the role of rapid binding site search for gene colocalization and emphasize the role of local concentration differences.

However, many biological reports have pointed out that mutated or flawed genes, named as risk genes, can be one of the major causes of a specific disease. This study proposes a gene selection method based on the risk genes found in biological reports. The information provided by risk genes can reduce the time complexity for gene selection and increase the accuracy of cancer classification. This gene selection method is composed of two stages. Since all risk genes must be chosen, the first stage is to remove the genes that have similar expression levels or functions to risk genes. The next stage is to perform gene selection and gene replacement based on the results of a process that divides the remaining genes into clusters. Based on the test results from four microarray data sets, our gene selection method outperforms those proposed by previous studies, and genes that have the potential to be new risk genes are presented.

It may occur in any part of body that has lymphocytes, and is closely correlated with diverse environmental factors such as the ionizing radiation, chemocarcinogenesis, and virus infection. All the environmental factors affect the lymphoma through genes. Identifying pathogenic genes for lymphoma is consequently an essential task to understand its complexity in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a new method to expose high-confident edges in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for a total of 32 organs, called Filtered GRNs (f-GRNs), comparison of which gives us a proper reference for the Lymphoma, i.e. the B-lymphocytes cells, whose f-GRN is closest with that for the Lymphoma. By using the Gene Ontology and Biological Process analysis we display the differences of the two networks' hubs in biological functions. Matching with the Genecards shows that most of the hubs take part in the genetic information transmission and expression, except a specific gene of Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (RARA) that encodes the retinoic acid receptor. In the lymphoma, the genes in the RARA ego-network are involved in two cancer pathways, and the RARA is present only in these cancer pathways. For the lymphoid B cells, however, the genes in the RARA ego-network do not participate in cancer-related pathways.

Antimicrobial treatment and vaccination provide only limited protection, but genetic disease resistance is a very promising alternative for sustainable prophylaxis. Previous studies have discovered multiple QTL that may explain up to 30% of phenotypic variance. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to use genomic sequencing to identify genetic markers for resistance to pleuropneumonia in a segregating commercial German Landrace line. 163 pigs were infected with A. pleuropneumoniae Serotype 7 through a standardized aerosol infection method. Phenotypes were accurately defined on a clinical, pathological and microbiological basis. The 58 pigs with the most extreme phenotypes were genotyped by sequencing (next-generation sequencing). SNPs were used in a genome-wide association study. The study identified genome-wide associated SNPs on three chromosomes, two of which were chromosomes of QTL which had been mapped in a recent experiment. Each variant explained up to 20% of the total phenotypic variance. Combined, the three variants explained 52.8% of the variance. The SNPs are located in genes involved in the pathomechanism of pleuropneumonia. This study confirms the genetic background for the host's resistance to pleuropneumonia and indicates a potential role of three candidates on SSC2, SSC12 and SSC15. Favorable gene variants are segregating in commercial populations. Further work is needed to verify the results in a controlled study and to identify the functional QTN.

Some neighboring genes show order conservation among species, while some neighboring genes separate during evolution even though their neighborhoods are conserved in some species. Here, I investigated whether after-separation gene repositioning is under natural selection for evolutionary conserved gene neighborhoods compared with nonconserved neighborhoods. After separation, genes with conserved neighborhoods show low-expression divergence between the after-separation species and the before-separation species. After genes separate from their conserved gene neighbors, their after-separation gene neighbors tend to show coexpression and coprotein complex with their before-separation gene neighbors. These results indicate evolutionary constraints on the selection of neighboring genes after evolutionary conserved gene neighborhoods separate.

Illumina digital gene expression profiling was applied in two sample types - peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and synovial cells to compare the gene expression pattern between 17 patients with RA and three control groups (six osteoarthritis patients, three ankylosing spondylitis patients and 17 healthy controls). Bioinformatics was performed on pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction networks. Four novel genes from PBMCs - DHRS3, TTC38, SAP30BP and LPIN2 - were found to be associated with RA and further confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Five new differentially expressed genes (EPYC, LIFR, GLDN, TADA3 and ZNRF3) found in synovial cells were not confirmed. Pathway analyses revealed 10 significantly enriched pathways, and a protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that four novel PBMC-derived genes were connected to previously reported genes by four intermediate genes. Therefore, we proposed that four newly identified PBMC-derived genes could be integrated with previously reported RA-associated genes to monitor and/or diagnose RA.

Primers were designed for the genes MUC2, TFF2, RPS13 and TBP using a degenerative primer design method based on the available Gallus gallus sequences. All primer sets, which produced a single PCR amplicon of the expected sizes, were cloned into the TOPOR (R) vector and then transformed into TOP 10 (R) competent cells. Plasmid DNA isolation was performed on the TOP10 (R) cell culture and sent for sequencing. Sequences were analyzed using NCBI BLAST. All genes sequenced had over 90% homology with both the chicken and predicted turkey sequences. The sequences were used to design new 100% homologous primer sets for the genes of interest.

Due to ethical constraints on human biopsies and the lack of suitable animal models, there has been little success in identifying functionally important genes in the pathogenesis of ectopic pregnancy. In the present study, we developed a random walk-based computational method named TM-rank to prioritize ectopic pregnancy-related genes based on text mining data and gene network information. Using a defined threshold value, we identified five top-ranked genes: VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), IL8 (interleukin 8), IL6 (interleukin 6), ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). These genes are promising candidate genes that can serve as useful diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our approach represents a novel strategy for prioritizing disease susceptibility genes.

Recently, several parametric/regression models have been developed utilizing the gene network information to select genes or pathways strongly associated with a clinical/biological outcome. Alternatively, in this paper, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for gene selection incorporating network information. In addition to identifying genes that have a strong association with a clinical outcome, our model can select genes with particular expressional behavior, in which case the regression models are not directly applicable. We show that our proposed model is equivalent to an infinity mixture model for which we develop a posterior computation algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We also propose two fast computing algorithms that approximate the posterior simulation with good accuracy but relatively low computational cost. We illustrate our methods on simulation studies and the analysis of Spellman yeast cell cycle microarray data.

Although an increasing number of genes have been identified to have independent effects on BMD, few studies have been performed to identify genes that interact with one another to affect BMD. In this study, we performed gene-gene interaction analyses in selected candidate genes in individuals with extremely high versus low hip BMD (20% tails of the distributions), in two independent U.S. Caucasian samples. The first sample contained 916 unrelated subjects with extreme hip BMD Z-scores selected from a population composed of 2286 subjects. The second sample consisted of 400 unrelated subjects with extreme hip BMD Z-scores selected from a population composed of 1000 subjects. Combining results from these two samples, we found one interacting gene pair (RBMS3 versus ZNF516) which, even after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, showed consistently significant effects on hip BMD. RMBS3 harbored two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs6549904 and rs7640046, both of which had significant interactions with an SNP, rs4891159, located on ZNF516 (p=7.04x1011 and 1.03x1010). We further validated these results in two additional samples of Caucasian and African descent. The gene pair, RBMS3 versus ZNF516, was successfully replicated in the Caucasian sample (p=8.07x103 and 2.91x103). For the African sample, a significant interaction was also detected (p=0.031 and 0.043), but the direction of the effect was opposite to that observed in the three Caucasian samples. By providing evidence for genetic interactions underlying BMD, this study further delineates the genetic architecture of osteoporosis. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Gene Fusion Markup Language: a prototype for exchanging gene fusion data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							MINIMUM INFORMATION; BREAST-CANCER; PROSTATE-CANCER; IDENTIFICATION; REARRANGEMENTS; STANDARDS; FORMAT; REPRESENTATION; CYTOGENETICS; CHROMOSOME	Background: An avalanche of next generation sequencing (NGS) studies has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic structural variation data. These studies have also identified many novel gene fusion candidates with more detailed resolution than previously achieved. However, in the excitement and necessity of publishing the observations from this recently developed cutting-edge technology, no community standardization approach has arisen to organize and represent the data with the essential attributes in an interchangeable manner. As transcriptome studies have been widely used for gene fusion discoveries, the current non-standard mode of data representation could potentially impede data accessibility, critical analyses, and further discoveries in the near future. Results: Here we propose a prototype, Gene Fusion Markup Language (GFML) as an initiative to provide a standard format for organizing and representing the significant features of gene fusion data. GFML will offer the advantage of representing the data in a machine-readable format to enable data exchange, automated analysis interpretation, and independent verification. As this database-independent exchange initiative evolves it will further facilitate the formation of related databases, repositories, and analysis tools. The GFML prototype is made available at http://code.google.com/p/gfml-prototype/. Conclusion: The Gene Fusion Markup Language (GFML) presented here could facilitate the development of a standard format for organizing, integrating and representing the significant features of gene fusion data in an inter-operable and query-able fashion that will enable biologically intuitive access to gene fusion findings and expedite functional characterization. A similar model is envisaged for other NGS data analyses.

One way to address this drawback is to consider higher level units such as genes or regions in the analysis. Earlier we proposed a statistic based on canonical correlations (CCU) as a gene-based method for detecting gene-gene co-association. However, it can only capture linear relationship and not nonlinear correlation between genes. We therefore proposed a counterpart (KCCU) based on kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA). Results: Through simulation the KCCU statistic was shown to be a valid test and more powerful than CCU statistic with respect to sample size and interaction odds ratio. Analysis of data from regions involving three genes on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 (GAW16) indicated that only KCCU statistic was able to identify interactions reported earlier. Conclusions: KCCU statistic is a valid and powerful gene-based method for detecting gene-gene co-association.

Deciphering the onychophoran 'segmentation gene cascade': Gene expression reveals limited involvement of pair rule gene orthologs in segmentation, but a highly conserved segment polarity gene network	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Onychophora; Development; Even-skipped; Runt; Hairy; Odd-skipped; Odd-paired; Sloppy-paired; Paired; Pairberry; Hedgehog; Patched; Cubitus-interruptus; Notum	ANNELID PLATYNEREIS-DUMERILII; GLOMERIS-MARGINATA MYRIAPODA; SHORT-GERM INSECT; JUVENILE DEVELOPMENT; DROSOPHILA SEGMENT; FUSHI-TARAZU; WINGLESS; PATTERNS; HEDGEHOG; PROTEIN	The hallmark of the arthropods is their segmented body, although origin of segmentation, however, is unresolved. In order to shed light on the origin of segmentation we investigated orthologs of pair rule genes (PRGs) and segment polarity genes (SPGs) in a member of the closest related sister-group to the arthropods, the onychophorans. Our gene expression data analysis suggests that most of the onychophoran PRGs do not play a role in segmentation. One possible exception is the even-skipped (eve) gene that is expressed in the posterior end of the onychophoran where new segments are likely patterned, and is also expressed in segmentation-gene typical transverse stripes in at least a number of newly formed segments. Other onychophoran PRGs such as runt (run), hairy/Hes (h/Hes) and odd-skipped (odd) do not appear to have a function in segmentation at all. Onychophoran PRGs that act low in the segmentation gene cascade in insects, however, are potentially involved in segment-patterning. Most obvious is that from the expression of the pairberry (pby) gene ortholog that is expressed in a typical SPG-pattern. Since this result suggested possible conservation of the SPG-network we further investigated SPGs (and associated factors) such as Notum in the onychophoran. We find that the expression patterns of SPGs in arthropods and the onychophoran are highly conserved, suggesting a conserved SPG-network in these two clades, and indeed also in an annelid. This may suggest that the common ancestor of lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans was already segmented utilising the same SPG-network, or that the SPG-network was recruited independently in annelids and onychophorans/arthropods.

Since, they are inherently biased toward disease genes, methods specific to pharmacogenetic (PGx) genes are required. Methods: We proposed a gene-wise variant burden (GVB) method that integrates in silico deleteriousness scores of the multitude of variants of a given gene at a personal-genome level. Results: GVB in its simplest form outperformed the two state-of-the-art methods with regard to predicting pharmacogenes and complex disease genes but not for rare Mendelian disease genes. GVB* adjusted by paralog counts robustly performed well in most of the pharmacogenetic subcategories. Seven molecular genetic features well characterized the unique genomic properties of PGx, complex, and Mendelian disease genes. Conclusion: Altogether, GVB is an individual-specific genescore, especially advantageous for PGx studies.

We develop TimeMeter, a statistical method and tool to assess temporal gene expression similarity, and identify differentially progressing genes where one pattern is more temporally advanced than the other. We apply TimeMeter to several datasets, and show that TimeMeter is capable of characterizing complicated temporal gene expression associations. Interestingly, we find: (i) the measurement of differential progression provides a novel feature in addition to pattern similarity that can characterize early developmental divergence between two species; (ii) genes exhibiting similar temporal patterns between human and mouse during neural differentiation are under strong negative (purifying) selection during evolution; (iii) analysis of genes with similar temporal patterns in mouse digit regeneration and axolotl blastema differentiation reveals common gene groups for appendage regeneration with potential implications in regenerative medicine.

The Gene Ontology database (GO) was developed to systematically describe the functional properties of gene products across species, and to facilitate the computational prediction of gene function. As GO is routinely updated, it serves as the gold standard and main knowledge source in functional genomics. Many gene function prediction methods making use of GO have been proposed. But no literature review has summarized these methods and the possibilities for future efforts from the perspective of GO. To bridge this gap, we review the existing methods with an emphasis on recent solutions. First, we introduce the conventions of GO and the widely adopted evaluation metrics for gene function prediction. Next, we summarize current methods of gene function prediction that apply GO in different ways, such as using hierarchical or flat inter-relationships between GO terms, compressing massive GO terms and quantifying semantic similarities. Although many efforts have improved performance by harnessing GO, we conclude that there remain many largely overlooked but important topics for future research.

As a representative, Gene set enrichment analysis has been widely used to interpret large molecular datasets generated by biological experiments. The result of gene set enrichment analysis heavily relies on the quality and integrity of gene set annotations. Although several methods were developed to annotate gene sets, there is still a lack of high quality annotation methods. Here, we propose a novel method to improve the annotation accuracy through combining the GO structure and gene expression data.ResultsWe propose a novel approach for optimizing gene set annotations to get more accurate annotation results. The proposed method filters the inconsistent annotations using GO structure information and probabilistic gene set clusters calculated by a range of cluster sizes over multiple bootstrap resampled datasets. The proposed method is employed to analyze p53 cell lines, colon cancer and breast cancer gene expression data. The experimental results show that the proposed method can filter a number of annotations unrelated to experimental data and increase gene set enrichment power and decrease the inconsistent of annotations.ConclusionsA novel gene set annotation optimization approach is proposed to improve the quality of gene annotations. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively improves gene set annotation quality based on the GO structure and gene expression data.

Young genes have distinct gene structure, epigenetic profiles, and transcriptional regulation	GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article							NEMATODE PRISTIONCHUS-PACIFICUS; HUMAN CELL-TYPES; DE-NOVO GENES; NATIVE CHROMATIN; RETROPOSED GENE; NONCODING RNAS; ORPHAN GENES; LIFE-STYLE; EVOLUTION; EXPRESSION	Species-specific, new, or "orphan" genes account for 10%-30% of eukaryotic genomes. Although initially considered to have limited function, an increasing number of orphan genes have been shown to provide important phenotypic innovation. How new genes acquire regulatory sequences for proper temporal and spatial expression is unknown. Orphan gene regulation may rely in part on origination in open chromatin adjacent to preexisting promoters, although this has not yet been assessed by genome-wide analysis of chromatin states. Here, we combine taxon-rich nematode phylogenies with Iso-Seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to identify the gene structure and epigenetic signature of orphan genes in the satellite model nematode Pristionchus pacificus. Consistent with previous findings, we find young genes are shorter, contain fewer exons, and are on average less strongly expressed than older genes. However, the subset of orphan genes that are expressed exhibit distinct chromatin states from similarly expressed conserved genes. Orphan gene transcription is determined by a lack of repressive histone modifications, confirming long-held hypotheses that open chromatin is important for new gene formation. Yet orphan gene start sites more closely resemble enhancers defined by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq peaks, in contrast to conserved genes that exhibit traditional promoters defined by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Although the majority of orphan genes are located on chromosome arms that contain high recombination rates and repressive histone marks, strongly expressed orphan genes are more randomly distributed. Our results support a model of new gene origination by rare integration into open chromatin near enhancers.

The transcription factor Neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) is required for islet development in mice, but its role in these dynamic morphogenetic steps has been inferred from fixed tissues. Moreover, little is known about the molecular genetic functions of NEUROG3 in human islet development. We developed methods for gene transduction by viral microinjection in the epithelium of cultured Neurog3-null mutant fetal pancreas, permitting genetic complementation in a developmentally relevant context. In addition, we developed methods for quantitative assessment of live-cell phenotypes in single developing islet cells. Delivery of wild-type NEUROG3 rescued islet differentiation, morphogenesis, and live cell deformation, whereas the patient-derived NEUROG3(R107S) allele partially restored indicators of islet development. NEUROG3(P39X), a previously unreported patient allele, failed to restore islet differentiation or morphogenesis and was indistinguishable from negative controls, suggesting that it is a null mutation. Our systems also permitted genetic suppression analysis and revealed that targets of NEUROG3, including NEUROD1 and RFX6, can partially restore islet development in Neurog3-null mutant mouse pancreata. Thus, advances described here permitted unprecedented assessment of gene functions in regulating crucial dynamic aspects of islet development in the fetal pancreas.

J	Zhou, XJ				Zhou, Xianjin			Over-representation of potential SP4 target genes within schizophrenia-risk genes	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article; Early Access							TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; EXPRESSION; PROMOTER; BINDING; ACTIVATION; FAMILY	Reduction of Sp4 expression causes age-dependent hippocampal vacuolization and many other intermediate phenotypes of schizophrenia in Sp4 hypomorphic mice. Recent human genetic studies from both the Schizophrenia Exome Sequencing Meta-Analysis (SCHEMA) and the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) validated SP4 as a schizophrenia-risk gene over the exome-wide or the genome-wide significance. Truncation of the human SP4 gene has an odds ratio of 9.37 (3.38-29.7) for schizophrenia. Despite successful identification of many schizophrenia-risk genes, it is unknown whether and how these risk genes may interact with each other in the development of schizophrenia. By taking advantage of the specific localization of the GC-boxes bound by SP4 transcription factors, I analyzed the relative abundance of these GC-boxes in the proximal promoter regions of schizophrenia-risk genes. I found that the GC-box containing genes are significantly over-represented within schizophrenia-risk genes, suggesting that SP4 is not only a high-risk gene for schizophrenia, but may also act as a hub of network in the regulation of many other schizophrenia-risk genes via these GC-boxes in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

ELEGANS; YEAST; PHENOTYPES; PATHS	Aging is a complex process with poorly understood genetic mechanisms. Recent studies have sought to classify genes as pro-longevity or anti-longevity using a variety of machine learning algorithms. However, it is not clear which types of features are best for optimizing classification performance and which algorithms are best suited to this task. Further, performance assessments based on held-out test data are lacking. We systematically compare five popular classification algorithms using gene ontology and gene expression datasets as features to predict the pro-longevity versus anti-longevity status of genes for two model organisms (C. elegans and S. cerevisiae) using the GenAge database as ground truth. We find that elastic net penalized logistic regression performs particularly well at this task. Using elastic net, we make novel predictions of pro- and anti-longevity genes that are not currently in the GenAge database.

Here, we studied the properties of HSM6 gene, the hsm6-1 mutation of which increased the frequency of UV-induced mutagenesis and decreased the level of UV-induced mitotic crossover at the region between the centromere and ADE2 gene. HSM6 gene was mapped on the left arm of chromosome II in the region where the PSY4 gene is located. The epistatic analysis has shown that the hsm6-1 mutation represents an allele of PSY4 gene. Sequencing of hsm6-1 mutant allele has revealed a frameshift mutation, which caused the Lys218Glu substitution and the generation of a stop codon in the next position. The interactions of hsm6-1 and rad52 mutations were epistatic. Our data show that the PSY4 gene plays a key role in the regulation of cell withdrawal from checkpoint induced by DNA disturbances.

Plants are exceptional among eukaryotic organisms in that duplicate loci compose a large fraction of their genomes, partly because of the frequent occurrence of polyploidy (or whole-genome duplication) events. Tandem gene duplication and transposition have also contributed to the large number of duplicated genes in plant genomes. Evolutionary analyses allowed the dynamics of duplicate gene evolution to be studied and several models were proposed. It seems that, over time, many duplicated genes were lost and some of those that were retained gained new functions and/or expression patterns (neofunctionalization) or subdivided their functions and/or expression patterns between them (subfunctionalization). Recent studies have provided examples of genes that originated by duplication with successive diversification within plants. In this review, we focused on the TEL (TERMINAL EAR1-like) genes to illustrate such mechanisms. Emerged from the mei2 gene family, these TEL genes are likely to be land plant-specific. Phylogenetic analyses revealed one or two TEL copies per diploid genome. TEL gene degeneration and loss in several Angiosperm species such as in poplar and maize seem to have occurred. In Arabidopsis thaliana, whose genome experienced at least three polyploidy events followed by massive gene loss and genomic reorganization, two TEL genes were retained and two new shorter TEL-like (MCT) genes emerged. Molecular and expression analyses suggest for these genes sub- and neofunctionalization events, but confirmation will come from their functional characterization.

Moreover, the respiratory tract can be targeted through noninvasive aerosolized formulations for inhalation. Therefore, gene therapy is considered a plausible strategy to address this disease. Conventional gene therapy strategies rely on the addition of a correct copy of the CFTR gene into affected cells in order to restore the channel activity. In recent years, genome correction strategies have emerged, such as zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated to Cas9 nucleases. These gene editing tools aim to repair the mutated gene at its original genomic locus with high specificity. Besides, the success of gene therapy critically depends on the nucleic acids carriers. To date, several clinical studies have been carried out to add corrected copies of the CFTR gene into target cells using viral and non-viral vectors, some of them with encouraging results. Regarding genome editing systems, preliminary in vitro studies have been performed in order to repair the CFTR gene. In this review, after briefly introducing the basis of CF, we discuss the up-to-date gene therapy strategies to address the disease. The review focuses on the main factors to take into consideration when developing gene delivery strategies, such as the design of vectors and plasmid DNA, in vitro/in vivo tests, translation to human use, administration methods, manufacturing conditions and regulatory issues.

We constructed a general human GRN from extensive transcription factor and microRNA target data obtained from public databases. In a subnetwork of this GRN that is active during estrogen stimulation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we benchmarked automated algorithms for identifying core regulatory genes (transcription factors and microRNAs). Among these algorithms, we identified K-core decomposition, pagerank and betweenness centrality algorithms as the most effective for discovering core regulatory genes in the network evaluated based on previously known roles of these genes in MCF-7 biology as well as in their ability to explain the up or down expression status of up to 70% of the remaining genes. Finally, we validated the use of K-core algorithm for organizing the GRN in an easier to interpret layered hierarchy where more influential regulatory genes percolate towards the inner layers.

However, there is currently no available biomarkers associated with HCC progression in clinical application. In our study, RNA sequencing expression data of 50 normal samples and 374 tumor samples was analyzed and 9225 differentially expressed genes were screened. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was then conducted and the blue module we were interested was identified by calculating the correlations between 17 gene modules and clinical features. In the blue module, the calculation of topological overlap was applied to select the top 30 genes and these 30 genes were divided into the green group (11 genes) and the yellow group (19 genes) through searching whether these genes were validated by in vitro or in vivo experiments. The genes in the green group which had never been validated by any experiments were recognized as hub genes. These hub genes were subsequently validated by a new data set GSE76427 and KM Plotter Online Tool, and the results indicated that 10 genes (FBXO43, ARHGEF39, MXD3, VIPR1, DNASE1L3, PHLDA1, CSRNP1, ADR2B, C1RL, and CDC37L1) could act as prognosis and progression biomarkers of HCC. In summary, 10 genes who have never been mentioned in HCC were identified to be associated with malignant progression and prognosis of patients. These findings may contribute to the improvement of the therapeutic decision, risk stratification, and prognosis prediction for HCC patients.

J	Sayyari, E; Whitfield, JB; Mirarab, S				Sayyari, Erfan; Whitfield, James B.; Mirarab, Siavash			Fragmentary Gene Sequences Negatively Impact Gene Tree and Species Tree Reconstruction	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						species tree estimation; gene trees; phylogenomics; fragmentary data; insect phylogeny	MISSING DATA; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EVIDENCE CONVERGE; COALESCENT; CONCATENATION; INFERENCE; RESOLVE; LAND; PHYLOGENOMICS	Species tree reconstruction from genome-wide data is increasingly being attempted, in most cases using a two-step approach of first estimating individual gene trees and then summarizing them to obtain a species tree. The accuracy of this approach, which promises to account for gene tree discordance, depends on the quality of the inferred gene trees. At the same time, phylogenomic and phylotranscriptomic analyses typically use involved bioinformatics pipelines for data preparation. Errors and shortcomings resulting from these preprocessing steps may impact the species tree analyses at the other end of the pipeline. In this article, we first show that the presence of fragmentary data for some species in a gene alignment, as often seen on real data, can result in substantial deterioration of gene trees, and as a result, the species tree. We then investigate a simple filtering strategy where individual fragmentary sequences are removed from individual genes but the rest of the gene is retained. Both in simulations and by reanalyzing a large insect phylotranscriptomic data set, we show the effectiveness of this simple filtering strategy.

So far, the main proportion of this heritability has not been found by single-locus genome-wide association studies. Therefore, the current study explored gene-gene interactions that have the potential to partially fill in the missing heritability. A two-stage discovery-confirmatory analysis was carried out in the Framingham Heart Study cohorts. The first stage was an exhaustive pairwise search performed in 2320 early-onset hypertensive cases with matched normotensive controls from the offspring cohort. Then, identified gene-gene interactions were assessed in an independent set of 694 subjects from the original cohort. Four unique gene-gene interactions were found to be related to hypertension. Three detected genes were recognized by previous studies, and the other 5 loci/genes (MAN1A1, LMO3, NPAP1/SNRPN, DNAL4, and RNA5SP455/KRT8P5) were novel findings, which had no strong main effect on hypertension and could not be easily identified by single-locus genome-wide studies. Also, by including the identified gene-gene interactions, more variance was explained in hypertension. Overall, our study provides evidence that the genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis has the possibility to identify new susceptibility genes, which can provide more insights into the genetic background of blood pressure regulation.

Bilateral mandibular osteotomies were performed in 45 New-Zealand rabbits. After a latency of 3 days, the mandibles were elongated using distractors with a rate of 0.8 mm/d for 7 days. After the completion of distraction, the rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups: 2 mu g (0.1 mu g/mu L) of recombinant plasmid pIRESh-VEGF165- hBMP-2, recombinant plasmid pIRES-hBMP2, recombinant plasmid pIRES-hVEGF165, pIRES, and the same volume of normal saline were injected into the distraction gap of groups A, B, C, D, and E, respectively, followed by electroporation. Three animals were killed at the 7th, 14th, and 28th day after gene transfected in different groups, respectively. The lengthened mandibles were harvested and processed for immunohistochemical examinations; the mean optic densities (MODs) and integral optical density of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)-positive cells were measured by CMIAS-2001A computerized image analyzer. The data were analyzed with SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Bonemorphogenetic protein 2 and TGF-beta 1 stainingwasmainly located in inflammatory cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes in the distraction zones. Their strongest expression reached to the peak at the seventh day and decreased at the 14th day of consolidation stage; at the 28th day, they expressed weakly. Image analysis results show that, at the seventh day, the expression of BMP-2 in group B (0.26 +/- 0.03, 0.36 +/- 0.02) was the strongest; there was significant difference among them (P < 0.01), whereas the expression of TGF-beta 1 in group C (0.38 +/- 0.06, 1.05 +/- 0.19) is strongest followed by group A (0.34 +/- 0.05, 0.95 +/- 0.16) and B (0.33 +/- 0.07, 0.90 +/- 0.19). At every time point, the level of expression of BMP-2 and TGF-beta 1 in gene therapy groups (groups A, B, and C) was remarkably higher than those in non-gene therapy groups(groups D and E). There were significant differences between gene therapy groups and non-gene therapy groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.001). These results indicated that local gene transfection can up-regulate the expression of osteogenic mediators (BMP-2 and TGF-beta 1), which may promote cell differentiation and proliferation and stimulate extracellular matrix synthesis and new bone formation in distraction gap.

Lagerstroemia indica (crape myrtle) is a popular ornamental plant in the world, but suitable endogenous reference genes are lacking. To find suitable reference genes, we evaluated the stabilities of nine candidate genes in six experimental data sets: six different tissues, three leaf colors, nine flower colors, and under three abiotic stresses (salt, drought, cold) using four statistical algorithms. A target gene LiMYB56 (homolog of Arabidopsis MYB56) was used to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the candidate reference genes. The results showed that the combination of two stably expressed reference genes, rather than a single reference gene, improved the accuracy of the qPCR. LiEF1 alpha-2 + LiEF1 alpha-3 was best for the tissue, salt treatment, and drought treatment sets; LiEF1 alpha-2 + LiEF1 alpha-1 was optimal for leaf color; LiEF1 alpha-2 + LiACT7 was optimal for cold treatment; and LiUBC + LiEF1 alpha-1 was best for the flower color set. Notably, LiEF1 alpha-2 had high expression stability in all six experimental sets, implying it may be a good reference gene for expression studies in L. indica. Our results will facilitate future gene expression studies in L. indica.

Here, based on an important double-deck loop model, the stochastic mechanisms of gene switching and energy dissipation are studied. First, the probability distributions of steady states are calculated theoretically. It is found that the signal can strengthen the choice of gene switching between the "off" and "on" states. Our analysis of energy consumption illustrates that, compared with the synthesis and degradation of proteins, the process of gene switching costs little energy. Our theoretical analysis reveals some interesting insights into the determination of cell state and energy dissipation for gene expression.

Detection of Imprinted Genes by Single-Cell Allele-Specific Gene Expression	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MATERNAL UNIPARENTAL DISOMY; WHITE BLOOD-CELLS; REGULATORY VARIATION; PRADER-WILLI; RNA-SEQ; MOUSE; DOMAIN; GENOME; GROWTH; SUGGESTS	Genomic imprinting results in parental-specific gene expression. Imprinted genes are involved in the etiology of rare syndromes and have been associated with common diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Standard RNA bulk cell sequencing applied to whole-tissue samples has been used to detect imprinted genes in human and mouse models. However, lowly expressed genes cannot be detected by using RNA bulk approaches. Here, we report an original and robust method that combines single-cell RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing into an optimized statistical framework to analyze genomic imprinting in specific cell types and in different individuals. Using samples from the probands of 2 family trios and 3 unrelated individuals, 1,084 individual primary fibroblasts were RNA sequenced and more than 700,000 informative heterozygous single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were genotyped. The allele-specific coverage per gene of each SNV in each single cell was used to fit a beta-binomial distribution to model the likelihood of a gene being expressed from one and the same allele. Genes presenting a significant aggregate allelic ratio (between 0.9 and 1) were retained to identify of the allelic parent of origin. Our approach allowed us to validate the imprinting status of all of the known imprinted genes expressed in fibroblasts and the discovery of nine putative imprinted genes, thereby demonstrating the advantages of single-cell over bulk RNA-seq to identify imprinted genes. The proposed single-cell methodology is a powerful tool for establishing a cell type-specific map of genomic imprinting.

DNA methylation in the gene body influences MeCP2-mediated gene repression	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						DNA methylation; Rett syndrome; MeCP2; transcription	CPG-BINDING PROTEIN-2; RETT-SYNDROME; EXPRESSION CHANGES; MECP2; MUTATIONS; SEQUENCE; DISEASE; DNMT3A	Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein gene (MECP2). MeCP2 is a methyl-cytosine binding protein that is proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor. However, multiple gene expression studies comparingwild-type andMeCP2-deficient neurons have failed to identify gene expression changes consistent with loss of a classical transcriptional repressor. Recent work suggests that one function of MeCP2 in neurons is to temper the expression of the longest genes in the genome by binding to methylated CA dinucleotides (mCA) within transcribed regions of these genes. Here we explore the mechanism ofmCA and MeCP2 in fine tuning the expression of long genes. We find that mCA is not only highly enriched within the body of genes normally repressed by MeCP2, but also enriched within extendedmegabase-scale regions surrounding MeCP2-repressed genes. Whereas enrichment of mCA exists in a broad region around these genes, mCA together with mCG within gene bodies appears to be the primary driver of gene repression by MeCP2. Disruption of methylation at CA sites within the brain results in depletion of MeCP2 across genes that normally contain a high density of gene-body mCA. We further find that the degree of gene repression by MeCP2 is proportional to the total number of methylated cytosine MeCP2 binding sites across the body of a gene. These findings suggest a model in which MeCP2 tunes gene expression in neurons by binding within the transcribed regions of genes to impede the elongation of RNA polymerase.

SCPP genes in the coelacanth: Tissue mineralization genes shared by sarcopterygians	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION			English	Review							LATIMERIA-CHALUMNAE SMITH; DENTIN SIALOPHOSPHOPROTEIN DSPP; SCANNING ELECTRON-MICROSCOPE; SECRETORY CALCIUM-BINDING; BONE SIALOPROTEIN; ENAMEL MATRIX; AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; DERMAL SKELETON	The coelacanth is the basal-most extant sarcopterygian that has teeth and tooth-like structures, comprising bone, dentin, and enamel or enameloid. Formation of these tissues involves many members of the secretory calcium-binding protein (SCPP) family. In tetrapods, acidic-residue-rich SCPPs are used in mineralization of bone and dentin, whereas Pro/Gln-rich SCPPs participate in enamel formation. Teleosts also employ many SCPPs for tissue mineralization. Nevertheless, the repertoire of SCPPs is largely different in teleosts and tetrapods; hence, filling this gap would be critical to elucidate early evolution of mineralized tissues in osteichthyans. In the present study, we searched for SCPP genes in the coelacanth genome and identified 11, of which two have clear orthologs in both tetrapods and teleosts, seven only in tetrapods, and two in neither of them. Given the divergence times of these vertebrate lineages, our discovery of this many SCPP genes shared between the coelacanth and tetrapods, but not with teleosts, suggests a complicated evolutionary scheme of SCPP genes in early osteichthyans. Our investigation also revealed both conserved and derived characteristics of SCPPs in the coelacanth and other vertebrates. Notably, acidic SCPPs independently evolved various acidic repeats in different lineages, while maintaining high acidity, presumably important for interactions with calcium. Furthermore, the three Pro/Gln-rich SCPP genes, required for mineralizing enamel matrix and confirmed only in tetrapods, were all identified in the coelacanth, strongly suggesting that enamel is equivalent in the coelacanth and tetrapods. This finding corroborates the previous proposition that true enamel evolved much earlier than the origin of tetrapods. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 322B: 390-402, 2014.

Gene therapy employing different types of viral and non-viral carriers to transport gene(s) of interest and facilitating production of the desirable therapeutic protein(s) has tremendous prospects in cancer treatments due to the high-level of specificity in therapeutic action of the expressed protein(s) with diminished off-target effects, although cancer cell-specific delivery of transgene(s) still poses some challenges to be addressed. Depending on the potential therapeutic target genes, cancer gene therapy could be categorized into tumor suppressor gene replacement therapy, immune gene therapy and enzyme- or prodrug-based therapy. This review would shed light on the current progress of delivery of potentially therapeutic genes into various cancer cells in vitro and animal models utilizing a variety of viral and non-viral vectors.

In this review, based on information retrieved from the literature or extracted from genome databases, it is hypothesised that the kallikrein locus is unique to mammals. The majority of genes are highly conserved, as demonstrated by the identification of 11 KLK genes in the opossum, a metatherian species. In contrast, a sublocus, encompassing KLK1-4, has gone through major transformations that have generated new genes, which in most cases are closely related to KLK1. In the primate lineage, this process created KLK3, the gene of the prostate cancer marker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), whereas in the murine lineage it gave rise to 13 genes unique to the mouse and nine unique to the rat. The KLK proteases are effector molecules that emerged early in mammalian evolution and their importance in skin homeostasis and male reproductive function is undisputed and there are also accumulating evidence for a role of KLK proteases in the development of the brain. It is speculated that the KLK gene family arose as part of the process that generated distinguishing mammalian features, like skin with hair and sweat glands, and specialised anatomical attributes of the brain and the reproductive tract.

If the mutations of such key genes could be tracked, it would be possible to predict the time of onset of dementia and significantly aid in developing drugs to treat dementia. However, gene finding involves tremendous cost, time and effort. To alleviate these problems, research on utilizing computational biology to decrease the search space of candidate genes is actively conducted. In this study, we propose a framework in which diseases, genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are represented by a layered network, and key genes are predicted by a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm utilizes a network-based semi-supervised learning model that can be applied to layered data structures. Results: The proposed method was applied to a dataset extracted from public databases related to diseases and genes with data collected from 186 patients. A portion of key genes obtained using the proposed method was verified in silico through PubMed literature, and the remaining genes were left as possible candidate genes.

Data from the genomes of humans and model organisms aid researchers to identify topics to study, which in turn improves predictive accuracy, facilitates the identification of relevant genes and simplifies the validation of laboratory data. The objective of the present study was to investigate the regulatory network constituted by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Microarray data from HCC datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and the Limma package in R was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and normal samples. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. TargetScan, microcosm, miRanda, miRDB and PicTar were used to predict target genes. lncRNAs associated with HCC were probed using the lncRNASNP database, and a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was visualized using Cytoscape. The present study identified 114 differentially expressed miRNAs and 2,239 differentially expressed mRNAs; of these, 725 were downregulated genes that were primarily involved in complement and coagulation cascades, fatty acid metabolism and butanoate metabolism, among others. The remaining 1,514 were upregulated genes principally involved in DNA replication, oocyte meiosis and homologous recombination, among others. Through the integrated analysis of associations between different types of RNAs and target gene prediction, the present study identified 203 miRNA-mRNA pairs, including 28 miRNAs and 170 mRNAs, and identified 348 lncRNA-miRNA pairs, containing 28 miRNAs. Therefore, owing to the association between lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs, the present study screened out 2,721 regulatory associations. The data in the present study provide a comprehensive bioin-formatic analysis of genes, functions and pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC.

With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, the construction and analysis of co-expression networks is now possible in non-model species, including those with agricultural importance. Here, we review fundamental concepts in the construction and application of co-expression networks with a focus on agricultural crops. We survey past and current applications of co-expression network analysis in several agricultural species and provide perspective on important considerations that arise when analyzing network relationships. We conclude with a perspective on future directions and potential challenges of utilizing this powerful approach in crops.

Multiple Testing of Gene Sets from Gene Ontology: Possibilities and Pitfalls	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						gene ontology; gene-set testing; false discovery rate; multiple testing	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; EXPRESSION DATA; LIMITATIONS; METASTASIS; HYPOTHESES; TERMS; GRAPH	The use of multiple testing procedures in the context of gene-set testing is an important but relatively underexposed topic. If a multiple testing method is used, this is usually a standard familywise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure in which the logical relationships that exist between the different (self-contained) hypotheses are not taken into account. Taking those relationships into account, however, can lead to more powerful variants of existing multiple testing procedures and can make summarizing and interpreting the final results easier. We will show that, from the perspective of interpretation as well as from the perspective of power improvement, FWER controlling methods are more suitable than FDR controlling methods. As an example of a possible power improvement, we suggest a modified version of the popular method by Holm, which we also implemented in the package .

Riboswitch-Mediated Gene Regulation: Novel RNA Architectures Dictate Gene Expression Responses	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY, VOL 70	Annual Review of Microbiology		English	Review; Book Chapter						RNA-mediated regulation; transcription attenuation; translational regulation; RNA structure	T-BOX RIBOSWITCH; TRANSCRIPTION TERMINATION CONTROL; S-MK BOX; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS; MESSENGER-RNA; SENSING RIBOSWITCH; BIOSYNTHESIS GENES; EUBACTERIA SENSE; STRUCTURAL BASIS; LEADER RNA	Riboswitches are RNA elements that act on the mRNA with which they are cotranscribed to modulate expression of that mRNA. These elements are widely found in bacteria, where they have a broad impact on gene expression. The defining feature of riboswitches is that they directly recognize a physiological signal, and the resulting shift in RNA structure affects gene regulation. The majority of riboswitches respond to cellular metabolites, often in a feedback loop to repress synthesis of the enzymes used to produce the metabolite. Related elements respond to the aminoacylation status of a specific tRNA or to a physical parameter, such as temperature or pH. Recent studies have identified new classes of riboswitches and have revealed new insights into the molecular mechanisms of signal recognition and gene regulation. Application of structural and biophysical approaches has complemented previous genetic and biochemical studies, yielding new information about how different riboswitches operate.

To test new nucleases, gRNA expression systems and other inventions in this field, several plant genes with visible phenotypic effects have been constantly used as targets. Anthocyanin pigmentation is one of the most easily identified traits, that does not require any additional treatment. It is also associated with stress resistance, therefore plants with edited anthocyanin genes might be of interest for agriculture. Phenotypic effect of CRISPR/Cas editing of PAP1 and its homologs, DFR, F3H and F3 ' H genes have been confirmed in several distinct plant species. DFR appears to be a key structural gene of anthocyanin biosynthesis, controlled by various transcription factors. There are still many promising potential model genes that have not been edited yet. Some of them, such as Delila, MYB60, HAT1, UGT79B2, UGT79B3 and miR156, have been shown to regulate drought tolerance in addition to anthocyanin biosynthesis. Genes, also involved in trichome development, such as TTG1, GLABRA2, MYBL2 and CPC, can provide increased visibility. In this review successful events of CRISPR/Cas editing of anthocyanin genes are summarized, and new model genes are proposed. It can be useful for molecular biologists and genetic engineers, crop scientists, plant genetics and physiologists.

Many studies have been conducted to identify diagnostic or prognostic gene signatures for cancer from gene expression profiles. However, some gene signatures may fail to serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and gene signatures may not be found in gene expression profiles. Methods: In this study, we developed a general method for constructing patient-specific gene correlation networks and for identifying prognostic gene pairs from the networks. A patient-specific gene correlation network was constructed by comparing a reference gene correlation network from normal samples to a network perturbed by a single patient sample. The main difference of our method from previous ones includes (1) it is focused on finding prognostic gene pairs rather than prognostic genes and (2) it can identify prognostic gene pairs from gene expression profiles even when no significant prognostic genes exist. Results: Evaluation of our method with extensive data sets of three cancer types (breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma) showed that our approach is general and that gene pairs can serve as more reliable prognostic signatures for cancer than genes. Conclusions: Our study revealed that prognosis of individual cancer patients is associated with the existence of prognostic gene pairs in the patient-specific network and the size of a subnetwork of the prognostic gene pairs in the patient-specific network. Although preliminary, our approach will be useful for finding gene pairs to predict survival time of patients and to tailor treatments to individual characteristics.

However, species recovery should benefit if natural mate choice could improve reproductive output (i.e. pair performance related to offspring number, such as increased clutch size, numbers of fertilized egg and fledglings). We assessed the evidence for major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-based mate preference in the endangered crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) and quantified the impacts of such choice on reproductive output. We tested the hypothesis that crested ibis advertise "good genes" through external traits, by testing whether nuptial plumage characteristics and body morphology mediate mate choice for underlying genetic MHC variation. We found differences between males and females in preferred MHC genotypes, external traits used in mate choice and contributions to reproductive outputs. Females preferred MHC-heterozygous males, which had darker [i.e. lower total reflectance and ultraviolet (UV) reflectance] nuptial plumage. Males preferred females lacking the DAB*d allele at the MHC class II DAB locus, which had higher average body mass. DAB*d-free females yielded heavier eggs and more fledglings, while MHC-heterozygous males contributed to more fertilized eggs and fledglings. Fledging rate was highest when both parents had the preferred MHC genotypes (i.e. MHC-heterozygous father and DAB*d-free mother). Comparisons showed that free-mating wild and semi-natural pairs yielded more fertilized eggs and more fledglings, with a higher fledging rate, than captive pairs matched artificially based on pedigree. Conservation programmes seldom apply modern research results to population management, which could hinder recovery of threatened species. Our results show that mate choice can play an important role in improving reproductive output, with an example in which an endangered bird selects mates using UV visual capability. Despite the undoubted importance of pedigree-based matching of mates in conservation programmes, we show that free mating can be a better alternative strategy.

J	Feijao, P; Araujo, E				Feijao, Pedro; Araujo, Eloi			Fast ancestral gene order reconstruction of genomes with unequal gene content	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Annual Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB) Comparative Genomics Satellite Workshop - Bioinformatics	OCT 11-14, 2016	Montreal, CANADA			Ancestral reconstruction; Small parsimony problem; Genome rearrangement; Double-cut-and-join; InDels; Gene insertions and deletions	REARRANGEMENT; JOIN; CUT	Background: During evolution, genomes are modified by large scale structural events, such as rearrangements, deletions or insertions of large blocks of DNA. Of particular interest, in order to better understand how this type of genomic evolution happens, is the reconstruction of ancestral genomes, given a phylogenetic tree with extant genomes at its leaves. One way of solving this problem is to assume a rearrangement model, such as Double Cut and Join (DCJ), and find a set of ancestral genomes that minimizes the number of events on the input tree. Since this problem is NP-hard for most rearrangement models, exact solutions are practical only for small instances, and heuristics have to be used for larger datasets. This type of approach can be called event-based. Another common approach is based on finding conserved structures between the input genomes, such as adjacencies between genes, possibly also assigning weights that indicate a measure of confidence or probability that this particular structure is present on each ancestral genome, and then finding a set of non conflicting adjacencies that optimize some given function, usually trying to maximize total weight and minimizing character changes in the tree. We call this type of methods homology-based. Results: In previous work, we proposed an ancestral reconstruction method that combines homology-and event-based ideas, using the concept of intermediate genomes, that arise in DCJ rearrangement scenarios. This method showed better rate of correctly reconstructed adjacencies than other methods, while also being faster, since the use of intermediate genomes greatly reduces the search space. Here, we generalize the intermediate genome concept to genomes with unequal gene content, extending our method to account for gene insertions and deletions of any length. In many of the simulated datasets, our proposed method had better results than MLGO and MGRA, two state-of-the-art algorithms for ancestral reconstruction with unequal gene content, while running much faster, making it more scalable to larger datasets. Conclusion: Studing ancestral reconstruction problems under a new light, using the concept of intermediate genomes, allows the design of very fast algorithms by greatly reducing the solution search space, while also giving very good results. The algorithms introduced in this paper were implemented in an open-source software called RINGO (ancestral Reconstruction with INtermediate GenOmes), available at https://github. com/pedrofeijao/RINGO.

Optimization of transfection efficiency and silencing efficiency by cationic liposome carriers requires a comprehensive understanding of the structures of CL-nucleic acid complexes and the nature of their interactions with cell membranes as well as events leading to release of active nucleic acids within the cytoplasm. Synchrotron X-ray scattering has revealed that CL-nucleic acid complexes spontaneously assemble into distinct liquid crystalline phases including the lamellar, inverse hexagonal, hexagonal, and gyroid cubic phases, and fluorescence microscopy has revealed CL-DNA pathways and interactions with cells. The combining of custom synthesis with characterization techniques and gene expression and silencing assays has begun to unveil structure-function relations in vitro. As a recent example, this review will briefly describe experiments with surface-functionalized PEGylated CL-DNA nanoparticles. The functionalization, which is achieved through custom synthesis, is intended to address and overcome cell targeting and endosomal escape barriers to nucleic acid delivery faced by PEGylated nanoparticles designed for in vivo applications.

However, several examples of HGT from pathogens into eukaryotic cells have been discovered and mimicked to improve non-viral gene delivery techniques. For example, several viral proteins and DNA sequences have been used to significantly increase cytoplasmic and nuclear gene delivery. Plant genetic engineering is routinely performed with the pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens and similar pathogens (e. g. Bartonella henselae) may also be able to transform human cells. Intracellular parasites like Trypanosoma cruzi may also provide new insights into overcoming cellular barriers to gene delivery. Finally, intercellular nucleic acid transfer between host cells will also be briefly discussed. This article will review the unique characteristics of several different viruses and microbes and discuss how their traits have been successfully applied to improve non-viral gene delivery techniques. Consequently, pathogenic traits that originally caused diseases may eventually be used to treat many genetic diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Preparation and characterization of magnetic gene vectors for targeting gene delivery	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Magnetite nanoparticle; Surface modification; Gene delivery	IN-VIVO; DNA; OLIGONUCLEOTIDE; TRANSFECTION; THERAPY; CELLS	The PEI-CMD-MNPs were successfully prepared by the surface modification of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles with carboxymethyl dextran (CMD) and polyethyleneimine (PEI). The PEI-CMD-MNPs polyplexes exhibited a typical superparamagnetic behavior and were well stable over the entire range of pH and NaCl concentration. These PEI-CMD-MNPs were used as magnetic gene vectors for targeting gene delivery. The prepared MNPs at different surface modification stages were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emissions canning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dynamic laser light scattering (DLS) analysis. The magnetic properties were studied by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). To evaluate the performance of the magnetic nanoparticles as gene transfer vector, the PEI-CMD-MNPs were used to delivery green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene into BHK21 cells. The expression of GFP gene was detected by fluorescence microscope. DNA-PEI-CMD-MNPs polyplexes absorbed by the cells were also monitored by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The transfection efficiency and gene expression efficiency of that transfected with a magnet were much higher than that of standard transfection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hong, R.

Gene Expression Commons: An Open Platform for Absolute Gene Expression Profiling	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS; MICROARRAY DATA; DATABASE; PROGENITORS; SIGNATURE; NETWORKS; LEUKEMIA	Gene expression profiling using microarrays has been limited to comparisons of gene expression between small numbers of samples within individual experiments. However, the unknown and variable sensitivities of each probeset have rendered the absolute expression of any given gene nearly impossible to estimate. We have overcome this limitation by using a very large number (>10,000) of varied microarray data as a common reference, so that statistical attributes of each probeset, such as the dynamic range and threshold between low and high expression, can be reliably discovered through meta-anyalysis This strategy is implemented in a web-based platform named "Gene Expression Commons" (https://gexc.stanford.edu/) which contains data of 39 distinct highly purified mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor/differentiated cell populations covering almost the entire hematopoietic system. Since the Gene Expression Commons is designed as an open platform, investigators can explore the expression level of any gene, search by expression patterns of interest, submit their own microarray data, and design their own working models representing biological relationship among samples.

They play a pivotal role in stem cell therapies, both autologous and allogeneic. In the field of gene and cell therapy, HSCs, genetically modified or otherwise, are used to alleviate or correct a genetic defect. In this concise review, we discuss the use of SFVpsc_huHSRV.13, formerly known as Prototype Foamy Viral (PFV or FV) vectors, as vehicles for gene delivery in HSCs. We present the properties of the FV vectors that make them ideal for HSC delivery vehicles, we review their record in HSC gene marking studies and their potential as therapeutic vectors for monogenic disorders in preclinical animal models. FVs are a safe and efficient tool for delivering genes in HSCs compared to other retroviral gene delivery systems. Novel technological advancements in their production and purification in closed systems, have allowed their production under cGMP compliant conditions. It may only be a matter of time before they find their way into the clinic.

The limitations of simple gene set enrichment analysis assuming gene independence	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Gene set enrichment analysis; gene expression	EXPRESSION DATA; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES; TOOL; ANNOTATION; DISCOVERY; BIOINFORMATICS; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; SIGNATURES	Since its first publication in 2003, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, has been heavily used, modified, and also questioned. Recently a simplified approach using a one-sample t-test score to assess enrichment and ignoring gene-gene correlations was proposed by Irizarry et al. 2009 as a serious contender. The argument criticizes Gene Set Enrichment Analysis's nonparametric nature and its use of an empirical null distribution as unnecessary and hard to compute. We refute these claims by careful consideration of the assumptions of the simplified method and its results, including a comparison with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis's on a large benchmark set of 50 datasets. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that gene-gene correlations cannot be ignored due to the significant variance inflation they produced on the enrichment scores and should be taken into account when estimating gene set enrichment significance. In addition, we discuss the challenges that the complex correlation structure and multi-modality of gene sets pose more generally for gene set enrichment methods.

The aim of this study was to find feature genes associated with osteosarcoma and correlative gene functions which can distinguish cancer tissues from non-tumor tissues. Gene expression profile GSE14359 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 10 osteosarcoma samples and 2 normal samples. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between osteosarcoma and normal specimens were identified using limma package of R. DAVID was applied to mine osteosarcoma associated genes and analyze the GO enrichment on gene functions and KEGG pathways. Then, corresponding protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed based on the data collected from STRING datasets. Principal component of top10 DEGs and PPI network of top 20 DEGs were further analyzed. Finally, transcription factors were predicted by uploading the two groups of DEGs to TfactS database. A total of 437 genes, including 114 up-regulated genes and 323 down-regulated genes, were filtered as DEGs, of which 46 were associated with osteosarcoma by Disease Module. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that genes mainly affected the process of immune response and the development of skeletal and vascular system. The PPI network analysis elucidated that hemoglobin and histocompatibility proteins and enzymes, which were associated with immune response, were closely associated with osteosarcoma. Transcription factors MYC and SP1 were predicted to be significantly related to osteosarcoma. The discovery of gene functions and transcription factors has the potential to use in clinic for diagnosis of osteosarcoma in future. In addition, it will pave the way to studying mechanism and effective therapies for osteosarcoma.

With the advent of new sequencing technologies, we are able to characterize and study gene expression levels and associated regulatory mechanisms in a large number of individuals and species at an unprecedented resolution and scale. We have thus gained new insights into the evolutionary pressures that shape gene expression levels and have developed an appreciation for the relative importance of evolutionary changes in different regulatory genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The current challenge is to link gene regulatory changes to adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes. Here we mainly focus on comparative studies in primates and how they are complemented by studies in model organisms.

To understand the rate and tract length of gene conversion, there are two major approaches. One is based on mutation-accumulation experiments, and the other uses natural DNA sequence variation. In this review, we overview the two major approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, to demonstrate the importance of statistical analysis of empirical and evolutionary data for estimating tract length, we apply a maximum likelihood method to several data sets.

However, the Caulobacter crescentus CB2A genome contains 114 insertions of genetic material from the closely-related NA1000 strain, providing a unique opportunity to analyze the horizontal transfer of genetic material. Analyses of these insertions led to a new model that involves preferential recombination at non-homologous regions that are flanked by regions of homology and does not involve any mutational processes. The net result is the replacement of segments of the recipient genome instead of the simple addition of genetic material during horizontal gene transfer. Analyses of the genomes of closely related strains of other bacterial and archaea genera, suggested that horizontal gene transfer occurs preferentially in non-homologous regions in these organisms as well. Thus, it appears to be a general phenomenon that prokaryotic horizontal gene transfer occurs preferentially at sites where the incoming DNA contains a non-homologous region that is flanked by regions of homology. Therefore, gene replacement is a common phenomenon during horizontal gene transfer.

Despite encouraging results, there is still some level of concerns on inoculating MSC in cancer patients. To face this issue, one possibility resides in engineering MSC by incorporating a suicide gene in order to control their fate once infused. Strategies based on Herpes Simplex Virus Thymidine Kinase (HSV-TK) and the Cytosine Deaminase genes have been developed and more recently a novel suicide gene, namely, iCasp9, has been proposed. This approach is based on a variant of human Caspase9 that binds with high affinity to a synthetic, bioinert small molecule (AP20187) leading to cell death. Based on this technology so far marginally applied to MSC, we tested the suitability of iCasp9 suicide strategy in MSC to further increase their safety. MSC have been transfected by a lentiviral vector carrying iCasp9 gene and then tested for viability after AP20187 treatment in comparison with mock-transfected cells. Moreover, accounting our anti-tumor approaches based on MSC expressing potent anti-cancer ligand TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), we generated adipose MSC co-expressing iCasp9 and TRAIL successfully targeting an aggressive sarcoma type. These data show that anti-cancer and suicide mechanisms can coexist without affecting cells performance and hampering the tumoricidal activity mediated by TRAIL. In conclusion, this study originally indicates the suitability of combining a MSC-based anti-cancer gene approach with iCasp9 demonstrating efficiency and specificity.

The known methods mainly focused on the selection or construction of features based on either genes or gene pairs on continuous-value gene expression data. However, few researches have been implemented to identify useful features based on both genes and gene pairs on binary-value gene expression data. Objective: In this work, we proposed a new algorithm, called FSGGP, to select both feature genes and feature gene pairs on the binary-value gene expression data to improve two-phenotype classification. Method: We calculated the uncertainty coefficient which represented how well a phenotype was described by a gene or gene pair under some possible relationship, and the exact relationship between the gene or gene pair and the phenotype was identified by the value of uncertainty coefficient. Furthermore, the closeness between genes or gene pairs and phenotypes was calculated, and the genes or gene pairs closely related with phenotypes were selected. The redundancy of genes and gene pairs as features was calculated by cross entropy on the binary data, and the redundant feature genes or gene pairs were eliminated. The optimal feature sets were obtained by the wrapper based forward feature selection for three classical classifiers. Results: The algorithm was experimentally assessed on four public datasets. The results showed that algorithm FSGGP had better performance over four known feature selection algorithms based on either genes or gene pairs in terms of the average classification error rates. Conclusion: We developed an algorithm to select both feature genes and feature gene pairs on the binary-value gene expression data, where the selection of feature gene pairs was implemented by identifying the higher logical relationship between gene pairs and phenotypes. The comparison with four known feature selection algorithms suggests that feature selection algorithms based on both genes and gene pairs can achieve better performance than feature selection algorithms based on either genes or gene pairs, and the identification of higher logical relationship is an effective approach for the selection of feature gene pairs.

While numerous methods have been proposed to infer the structure of gene regulatory networks, none of them seem to work consistently over different data sets with high accuracy. A recent study to compare gene network inference methods showed that an average-ranking-based consensus method consistently performs well under various settings. Here, we propose a linear programming-based consensus method for the inference of gene regulatory networks. Unlike the average-ranking-based one, which treats the contribution of each individual method equally, our new consensus method assigns a weight to each method based on its credibility. As a case study, we applied the proposed consensus method on synthetic and real microarray data sets, and compared its performance to that of the average-ranking-based consensus and individual inference methods. Our results show that our weighted consensus method achieves superior performance over the unweighted one, suggesting that assigning weights to different individual methods rather than giving them equal weights improves the accuracy.

Detecting gene-gene interactions using a permutation-based random forest method	BIODATA MINING			English	Article						Random forest; GWAS; Machine learning; Scale invariant	MULTIFACTOR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; EPISTATIC MODELS; RISK; DISEASE; STRICT; PURE; SNPS	Background: Identifying gene-gene interactions is essential to understand disease susceptibility and to detect genetic architectures underlying complex diseases. Here, we aimed at developing a permutation-based methodology relying on a machine learning method, random forest (RF), to detect gene-gene interactions. Our approach called permuted random forest (pRF) which identified the top interacting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs by estimating how much the power of a random forest classification model is influenced by removing pairwise interactions. Results: We systematically tested our approach on a simulation study with datasets possessing various genetic constraints including heritability, number of SNPs, sample size, etc. Our methodology showed high success rates for detecting the interaction SNP pair. We also applied our approach to two bladder cancer datasets, which showed consistent results with well-studied methodologies, such as multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and statistical epistasis network (SEN). Furthermore, we built permuted random forest networks (PRFN), in which we used nodes to represent SNPs and edges to indicate interactions. Conclusions: We successfully developed a scale-invariant methodology to detect pure gene-gene interactions based on permutation strategies and the machine learning method random forest. This methodology showed great potential to be used for detecting gene-gene interactions to study underlying genetic architectures in a scale-free way, which could be benefit to uncover the complex disease mechanisms.

Drosophila X-Linked Genes Have Lower Translation Rates than Autosomal Genes	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Drosophila; codon usage bias; translation rates; sex chromosome	SYNONYMOUS CODON USAGE; HETEROLOGOUS PROTEIN EXPRESSION; CHROMOSOME DOSAGE COMPENSATION; MESSENGER-RNA; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SEX-CHROMOSOME; IN-VIVO; BIAS; MELANOGASTER	In Drosophila, X-linked and autosomal genes achieve comparable expression at the mRNA level. Whether comparable X-autosome gene expression is realized at the translational and, ultimately, the protein levels is, however, unknown. Previous studies suggest the possibility of higher translation rates for X-linked genes owing to stronger usage of preferred codons. In this study, we use public ribosome profiling data from Drosophila melanogaster to infer translation rates on the X chromosome versus the autosomes. We find that X-linked genes have consistently lower ribosome densities than autosomal genes in S2 cells, early embryos, eggs, and mature oocytes. Surprisingly, the lower ribosome densities of X-linked genes are not consistent with faster translation elongation but instead imply slower translation initiation. In particular, X-linked genes have sequence features known to slow translation initiation such as stronger mRNA structure near start codons and longer 5'-UTRs. Comparison to outgroup species suggests that stronger mRNA structure is an evolved feature of Drosophila X chromosomes. Finally, we find that the magnitude of the X-autosome difference in ribosome densities is smaller for genes encoding members of protein complexes, suggesting that stoichiometry constrains the evolution of translation rates. In sum, our analyses suggest that Drosophila X-linked genes have evolved lower translation rates than autosomal genes despite stronger usage of preferred codons.

They help to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around histone octamers to form nucleosomes which serve the purpose of compacting DNA within the confines of the nuclear membrane. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Amino acids such as lysine and arginine found in the histone tails are sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation and acetylation. These PTMs in histones are involved in the regulation of gene expression by chromatin remodelling and by controlling DNA methylation patterns. Mutations in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs causing changes in local and global DNA methylation status. These effects are directly linked to neoplastic transformation by altered gene expression. Recurrent H3.3 histone mutations are increasingly identified in several malignancies and developmental disorders. The following review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with H3.3 histone mutations.

Surprisingly, a modest correlation was observed between the expression of transcription factors and their targets and, most noteworthy, both activating and repressing interactions were associated with positive correlation. When evaluated using a sign consistency model we found the regulatory network was not more consistent with measured expression than random network models. We conclude that, at least in E. coli, one cannot expect a causal relationship between the expression of transcription and factors their targets, and that the current static GRN does not adequately explain transcriptional regulation. The implications of this are profound as they question what we consider established knowledge of the systemic biology of cells and point to methodological limitations with respect to single omics analysis, static networks and temporality.

J	Ud-Dean, SMM; Gunawan, R				Ud-Dean, S. M. Minhaz; Gunawan, Rudiyanto			Optimal design of gene knockout experiments for gene regulatory network inference	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							EXPRESSION; DELETIONS	Motivation: We addressed the problem of inferring gene regulatory network (GRN) from gene expression data of knockout (KO) experiments. This inference is known to be underdetermined and the GRN is not identifiable from data. Past studies have shown that suboptimal design of experiments (DOE) contributes significantly to the identifiability issue of biological networks, including GRNs. However, optimizing DOE has received much less attention than developing methods for GRN inference. Results: We developed REDuction of UnCertain Edges (REDUCE) algorithm for finding the optimal gene KO experiment for inferring directed graphs (digraphs) of GRNs. REDUCE employed ensemble inference to define uncertain gene interactions that could not be verified by prior data. The optimal experiment corresponds to the maximum number of uncertain interactions that could be verified by the resulting data. For this purpose, we introduced the concept of edge separatoid which gave a list of nodes (genes) that upon their removal would allow the verification of a particular gene interaction. Finally, we proposed a procedure that iterates over performing KO experiments, ensemble update and optimal DOE. The case studies including the inference of Escherichia coli GRN and DREAM 4 100-gene GRNs, demonstrated the efficacy of the iterative GRN inference. In comparison to systematic KOs, REDUCE could provide much higher information return per gene KO experiment and consequently more accurate GRN estimates. Conclusions: REDUCE represents an enabling tool for tackling the underdetermined GRN inference. Along with advances in gene deletion and automation technology, the iterative procedure brings an efficient and fully automated GRN inference closer to reality.	[Ud-Dean, S. M.

Anti-inflammatory genes associated with multiple sclerosis: A gene expression study	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Inflammation; Gene expression; GWAS	INFLAMMATION; DISEASE; PROTEINS; ROLES; LOCUS; RISK	Multiple sderosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system caused by a complex interaction between multiple genes and environmental factors. HLA region is the strongest susceptibility locus, but recent huge genome-wide association studies identified new susceptibility genes. Among these, BACH2, PTGER4, RGS1 and ZFP36L1 were highlighted. Here, a gene expression analysis revealed that three of them, namely BACH2, PTGER4 and ZFP36L1, are down-regulated in MS patients' blood cells compared to healthy subjects. Interestingly, all these genes are involved in the immune system regulation with predominant anti-inflammatory role and their reduction could predispose to MS development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The screening moreover identifies a large number of variants, for example, missense, silent, and intron variants, which are classified as variants of unknown clinical significance owing to the lack of causal evidence. Variants of unknown clinical significance can potentially have an impact on splicing and therefore functional examinations are warranted to classify whether these variants are pathogenic or benign. Here we validate a mini-gene splicing assay by comparing the results of 24 variants with previously published data from RT-PCR analysis on RNA from blood samples/lymphoblastoid cell lines. The analysis showed an overall concordance of 100%. In addition, we investigated 13 BRCA1 variants of unknown clinical significance or putative variants affecting splicing by in silico analysis and mini-gene splicing assay. Both the in silico analysis and mini-gene splicing assay classified six BRCA1 variants as pathogenic (c.80 vertical bar 1G>A, c.132C>T (p. =), c.213 1G>A, c.670 vertical bar 1delG, c.4185 vertical bar 1G>A, and c.5075 1G>C), whereas six BRCA1 variants were classified as neutral (c.-19-22_-19-21dupAT, c.302-15C>G, c.547+14delG, c.4676-20A>G, c.4987-21G>T, and c.5278-14C>G) and one BRCA1 variant remained unclassified (c.670+16G>A). In conclusion, our study emphasizes that in silico analysis and mini-gene splicing assays are important for the classification of variants, especially if no RNA is available from the patient. This knowledge is crucial for proper genetic counseling of patients and their family members.

Leveraging global gene expression patterns to predict expression of unmeasured genes	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Gene expression; Greedy gene set selection; GGS; Imputation	OVARIAN-CANCER; SUBTYPES; SIGNATURE	Background: Large collections of paraffin-embedded tissue represent a rich resource to test hypotheses based on gene expression patterns; however, measurement of genome-wide expression is cost-prohibitive on a large scale. Using the known expression correlation structure within a given disease type (in this case, high grade serous ovarian cancer; HGSC), we sought to identify reduced sets of directly measured (DM) genes which could accurately predict the expression of a maximized number of unmeasured genes. Results: We developed a greedy gene set selection (GGS) algorithm which returns a DM set of user specified size based on a specific correlation threshold (vertical bar r(P)vertical bar) and minimum number of DM genes that must be correlated to an unmeasured gene in order to infer the value of the unmeasured gene (redundancy). We evaluated GGS in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HGSC data across 144 combinations of DM size, redundancy (1-3), and vertical bar r(P)vertical bar (0.60, 0.65, 0.70). Across the parameter sweep, GGS allows on average 9 times more gene expression information to be captured compared to the DM set alone. GGS successfully augments prognostic HGSC gene sets; the addition of 20 GGS selected genes more than doubles the number of genes whose expression is predictable. Moreover, the expression prediction is highly accurate. After training regression models for the predictable gene set using 2/3 of the TCGA data, the average accuracy (ranked correlation of true and predicted values) in the 1/3 testing partition and four independent populations is above 0.65 and approaches 0.8 for conservative parameter sets. We observe similar accuracies in the TCGA HGSC RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, the prediction accuracy increases with increasing redundancy and increasing vertical bar r(P)vertical bar. Conclusions: GGS-selected genes, which maximize expression information about unmeasured genes, can be combined with candidate gene sets as a cost effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in large studies. This method can be applied to any organism, model system, disease, or tissue type for which whole genome gene expression data exists.

Camera: a competitive gene set test accounting for inter-gene correlation	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES; EXPRESSION DATA; PROGENITORS; POPULATION; PATHWAYS; MODELS; LEVEL	Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.

Specifically M. sexta has long been a major model species in the field, especially regarding the importance of olfaction in an ecological context, mainly the interaction with its host plants. In recent years transcriptomic data has led to the discovery of members of all major chemosensory receptor families in the species, but the data was fragmentary and incomplete. Here we present the analysis of the newly available high-quality genome data for the species, supplemented by additional transcriptome data to generate a high quality reference gene set for the three major chemosensory receptor gene families, the gustatory (GR), olfactory (OR) and antennal ionotropic receptors (IR). Coupled with gene expression analysis our approach allows association of specific receptor types and behaviors, like pheromone and host detection. The dataset will provide valuable support for future analysis of these essential chemosensory modalities in this species and in Lepidoptera in general. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, it shows a highly specific expression pattern in embryos, larvae, and adults, and has been implicated in larval development, stress resistance, and in the setting of adult lifespan, among others. Although mth belongs to a gene subfamily with 16 members in D. melanogaster, there is no evidence for functional redundancy in this subfamily. Therefore, it is surprising that a novel gene influences so many traits. Here, we explore the alternative hypothesis that mth is an old gene. Under this hypothesis, in species distantly related to D. melanogaster, there should be a gene with features similar to those of mth. By performing detailed phylogenetic, synteny, protein structure, and gene expression analyses we show that the D. virilis GJ12490 gene is the orthologous of mth in species distantly related to D. melanogaster. We also show that, in D. americana (a species of the virilis group of Drosophila), a common amino acid polymorphism at the GJ12490 orthologous gene is significantly associated with developmental time, size, and lifespan differences. Our results imply that GJ12490 orthologous genes are candidates for developmental time and lifespan differences in Drosophila in general.

The norepinephrine transporter gene is a candidate gene for panic disorder	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						Panic disorder (PD); Association; Candidate gene; Norepinephrine transporter (NET; SLC6A2); Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)	ASSOCIATION; ANXIETY; TRANSCRIPTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MATINSPECTOR; COMORBIDITY; AGORAPHOBIA; DEPRESSION; SEQUENCE	Panic disorder (PD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent panic attacks with a lifetime prevalence of 4.7%. Genetic factors are known to contribute to the development of the disorder. Several lines of evidence point towards a major role of the norepinephrine system in the pathogenesis of PD. The SLC6A2 gene is located on chromosome 16q12.2 and encodes the norepinephrine transporter (NET), responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine into presynaptic nerve terminals. The aim of the present study was to analyze genetic variants located within the NET gene for association with PD. The case-control sample consisted of 449 patients with PD and 279 ethnically matched controls. All cases fulfilled the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for PD. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom platform (Sequenom, Inc, San Diego, USA). To test for allelic and haplotypic association, the PLINK software was used, and COMBASSOC was applied to test for gene-wise association. After quality control 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the gene-region were successfully analyzed. Seven SNPs located within the 5' end of the gene were significantly associated with PD. Furthermore, the NET gene showed overall evidence for association with the disease (P = 0.000035). In conclusion, the present study indicates that NET could be a susceptibility gene for PD.	[Buttenschon, H. N.; Kristensen, A. S.; Buch, H. N.; Borglum, A.

Alex			Uncovering biomarker genes with enriched classification potential from Hallmark gene sets	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; PATHWAYS	Given the complex relationship between gene expression and phenotypic outcomes, computationally efficient approaches are needed to sift through large high-dimensional datasets in order to identify biologically relevant biomarkers. In this report, we describe a method of identifying the most salient biomarker genes in a dataset, which we call "candidate genes", by evaluating the ability of gene combinations to classify samples from a dataset, which we call "classification potential". Our algorithm, Gene Oracle, uses a neural network to test user defined gene sets for polygenic classification potential and then uses a combinatorial approach to further decompose selected gene sets into candidate and non-candidate biomarker genes. We tested this algorithm on curated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) quantified in RNAseq gene expression matrices obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data repositories. First, we identified which MSigDB Hallmark subsets have significant classification potential for both the TCGA and GTEx datasets. Then, we identified the most discriminatory candidate biomarker genes in each Hallmark gene set and provide evidence that the improved biomarker potential of these genes may be due to reduced functional complexity.

To assess the scenario of the actual changes, metagenomics experiments aimed at sequencing genomic DNA from such samples are performed. These new obtained sequences together with already known are used to infer phylogenetic trees assessing the taxonomic groups the species with these genes belong to. Here, we propose the first approach to the gene-species assignment problem by using reconciliation with horizontal gene transfer. Results: We propose efficient algorithms that search for optimal gene-species mappings taking into account gene duplication, loss and transfer events under two tractable models of HGT reconciliation. Conclusions: We calculate both the optimal cost and all possible optimal scenarios. Furthermore as the number of optimal reconstructions can be large, we use a Monte-Carlo method for the inference of approximate distributions of gene-species assignments. We demonstrate the applicability on empirical and simulated datasets.

Among these there is the stimulation of select histogenetic subroutines for purposes of cell-based brain repair, as well as the therapeutic treatment of gene expression deficits underlying severe neurological disorders. We employed RNA activation (RNAa) to transactivate the Emx2 transcription factor gene in embryonic cortico-cerebral precursor cells. This led to enhanced self-renewal, delayed differentiation, and reduced death of neuronally committed precursors, resulting in a remarkable expansion of the neuronogenic precursors pool. These results are of paramount interest for purposes of gene-promoted brain repair. As such, RNAa makes therapeutic stimulation of neuronogenesis via Emx2 overexpression a feasible goal, preventing the drawbacks of exogenous gene copies introduction. Moreover, we employed RNAa to achieve a gentle transactivation of the Foxg1 transcription factor gene, specifically in cortico-cerebral cells. This manipulation led to an appreciable biological outcome, while complying with endogenous gene tuning linked to early central nervous system regionalization and late activity of neocortical projection neurons. Foxg1-activating miRNAs stimulated RNApolII recruitment, possibly via Ago1. One of them worked promisingly in vivo. As such, RNAa can be a valuable approach for therapeutic treatment of the FOXG1-haploinsufficiency-linked variant of the Rett syndrome. Remarkably, hemizygosity for specific genes and polygenic chromosomal segments underlies a huge number of neuropathological entities for which no cure is presently available.

Hence, which genes undergo duplication and are preserved following duplication is an important question. It has been observed that gene duplicability, or the ability of genes to be retained following duplication, is a nonrandom process, with certain genes being more amenable to survive duplication events than others. Primarily, gene essentiality and the type of duplication (small-scale versus large-scale) have been shown in different species to influence the (long-term) survival of novel genes. However, an overarching view of "gene duplicability" is lacking, mainly due to the fact that previous studies usually focused on individual species and did not account for the influence of genomic context and the time of duplication. Here, we present a large-scale study in which we investigated duplicate retention for 9178 gene families shared between 37 flowering plant species, referred to as angiosperm core gene families. For most gene families, we observe a strikingly consistent pattern of gene duplicability across species, with gene families being either primarily single-copy or multicopy in all species. An intermediate class contains gene families that are often retained in duplicate for periods extending to tens of millions of years after whole-genome duplication, but ultimately appear to be largely restored to singleton status, suggesting that these genes may be dosage balance sensitive. The distinction between single-copy and multicopy gene families is reflected in their functional annotation, with single-copy genes being mainly involved in the maintenance of genome stability and organelle function and multicopy genes in signaling, transport, and metabolism. The intermediate class was overrepresented in regulatory genes, further suggesting that these represent putative dosage-balance-sensitive genes.

More knowledge about the complex etiology of obesity is needed in order to find additional approaches for treatment and prevention. Investigating the exome sequencing data of 30 extremely obese subjects (BMI 45-65 kg/m(2)) shows that predicted damaging missense variants in olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 1q and rare predicted damaging variants in the protocadherin (PCDH) beta-cluster genes on chromosome 5q31, reported in our previous work, co-localize in subjects with extreme obesity. This implies a synergistic effect between genetic variation in these gene clusters in the predisposition to extreme obesity. Evidence for a general involvement of the olfactory transduction pathway on itself could not be found. Bioinformatic analysis indicates a specific involvement of the PCDH beta-cluster genes in controlling tissue development. Further mechanistic insight needs to await the identification of the ligands of the 1q olfactory receptors. Eventually, this may provide the possibility to manipulate food flavor in a way to reduce the risk of overeating and of extreme obesity in genetically predisposed subjects.	[Mariman, Edwin C.

In this study, a UV-degradable gene carrier material (ENE4-1) was synthesized by crosslinking low molecular weight branched polyethylenimine (bPEI-2k) molecules using UV-cleavable o-nitrobenzyl urethane (NBU) as the linker molecule. NBU degrades upon exposure to mild UV irradiation. Therefore, this UV-degradable carrier allows us to control the chemical characteristics of the polymer/DNA complex (polyplex) particles at desired locations within the intracellular environment. By using this photolytic DNA carrier, we found that the exact timing of the UV degradation significantly influences the gene transfection efficiencies of ENE4-1/DNA(pGL2) polyplexes in HeLa cells. Interestingly, even if the polyplexes were UV-degraded at different intracellular locations/times, their nuclear entry efficiency was not influenced by the location/timing of UV degradation. The UV treatment did not influence the size or binding strength of the polyplexes. However, we confirmed that the degradation of the carrier molecules impacts the chemical characteristics of the polyplexes (it produces carbamic acid and nitrosobenzyl aldehyde groups on ENE4-1). We believe that these anionic acid groups enhance the interaction of the polyplexes with nuclear transcription proteins and thus the final gene expression levels; this effect was found to occur, even though UV irradiation itself has a general effect of reducing transfection efficiencies. Excess (uncomplexed) ENE4-1 polymers appear to not play any role in the UV-enhanced gene transcription phenomenon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MBD3 Localizes at Promoters, Gene Bodies and Enhancers of Active Genes	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							CHROMATIN REMODELER MI-2-BETA; DNA METHYLATION; MODIFYING ENZYMES; LOCATION ANALYSIS; CELL-LINES; EXPRESSION; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; REGULATORS; NURD	The Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a multiprotein machine proposed to regulate chromatin structure by nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation activities. Recent reports describing localization of NuRD provide new insights that question previous models on NuRD action, but are not in complete agreement. Here, we provide location analysis of endogenous MBD3, a component of NuRD complex, in two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) using two independent genomic techniques: DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and ChIP-seq. We observed concordance of the resulting genomic localization, suggesting that these studies are converging on a robust map for NuRD in the cancer cell genome. MBD3 preferentially associated with CpG rich promoters marked by H3K4me3 and showed cell-type specific localization across gene bodies, peaking around the transcription start site. A subset of sites bound by MBD3 was enriched in H3K27ac and was in physical proximity to promoters in three-dimensional space, suggesting function as enhancers. MBD3 enrichment was also noted at promoters modified by H3K27me3. Functional analysis of chromatin indicated that MBD3 regulates nucleosome occupancy near promoters and in gene bodies. These data suggest that MBD3, and by extension the NuRD complex, may have multiple roles in fine tuning expression for both active and silent genes, representing an important step in defining regulatory mechanisms by which NuRD complex controls chromatin structure and modification status.

However, this measurement veils the complexity of gene flow, especially in the case of gene stacking. We have investigated the impact of gene stacking on adventitious GM presence due to pollen flow and seed admixture as well as its translation in terms of the percentage of GM-DNA in a non-GM maize harvest. In the case of varieties bearing one to four stacked events, we established a set of relationships between the percentage of GM kernels and the percentage of GM-DNA in a non-GM harvest as well as a set of relationships between the rate of seed admixture and the percentages of GM material in a non-GM harvest. Thanks to these relationships, and based on simulations with a gene flow model, we have been able to demonstrate that the number of events and the stacking structure of the emitting fields impact the ability of a non-GM maize producer to comply with given GM kernel or GM-DNA thresholds. We also show that a great variability in the rates of GM kernels, embryos and DNA results from seed admixture. Finally, the choice of a unit of measurement for a GM threshold in seed lots can have opposite effects on the ability of farmers to comply with a given threshold depending on whether they are crop or seed producers.

A gene team tree is a succinct way to represent all gene teams for every possible value of delta. In this paper, improved algorithms are presented for the problem of finding the gene teams of two chromosomes and the problem of constructing a gene team tree of two chromosomes. For the problem of finding gene teams, Beal et al. had an O(n lg(2) n)-time algorithm. Our improved algorithm requires O(n lg t) time, where t <= n is the number of gene teams. For the problem of constructing a gene team tree, Zhang and Leong had an O(n lg(2) n)-time algorithm. Our improved algorithm requires O(n lg n lglg n) time. Similar to Beal et al.'s gene team algorithm and Zhang and Leong's gene team tree algorithm, our improved algorithms can be extended to k chromosomes with the time complexities increased only by a factor of k.

It allows users to query protein or nucleotide sequences against global ocean reference gene catalogs. With just one click, the abundance and location of target sequences are visualized on world maps as well as their taxonomic distribution. Interactive results panels allow for adjusting cutoffs for alignment quality and displaying the abundances of genes in the context of environmental features (temperature, nutrients, etc.) measured at the time of sampling. The ease of use enables non-bioinformaticians to explore quantitative and contextualized information on genes of interest in the global ocean ecosystem. Currently the Ocean Gene Atlas is deployed with (i) the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog (OM-RGC) comprising 40 million non-redundant mostly prokaryotic gene sequences associated with both Tara Oceans and Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) gene abundances and (ii) the Marine Atlas of Tara Ocean Unigenes (MATOU) composed of > 116 million eukaryote unigenes.

In addition, we further analyzed the effect of LPA gene expression on plasma levels of Lp(a) and CAD risk. First, five SNPs (rs1367211, rs3127596, rs6415085, rs9347438, and rs9364559) in LPA gene were genotyped using the SEQUENOM Mass-ARRAY system in two groups. Second, we used quantitative real-time PCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of LPA gene in 92 cases and 32 controls. Results showed that the frequency of rs6415085-T allele was significantly higher in case group than that in control group (p < 0.05). Haplotypes were not associated with CAD risk (p > 0.05). And cases with the TT/TG genotype had significantly higher plasma Lp(a) levels compared with those that have the rs6415085 GG genotype (p < 0.05). Additionally, the mRNA expression levels in case group are significantly higher than that in control group (p < 0.05). Our study confirmed that rs6415085 was associated with CAD and increased plasma Lp(a) levels. And increased mRNA expression level of LPA gene may be a mechanism in development of CAD.

J	Babron, MC; Etcheto, A; Dizier, MH				Babron, Marie-Claude; Etcheto, Adrien; Dizier, Marie-Helene			A New Correction for Multiple Testing in Gene-Gene Interaction Studies	ANNALS OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						Association; gene-gene interaction; multiple testing	ASSOCIATION; LOCI	A major problem in gene-gene interaction studies in large marker panels is how to correct for multiple testing while accounting for the dependence between marker pairs due to the presence of linkage disequilibrium. The gold standard approach is to perform permutations of case/control labels. However, this is often not feasible in practice, due to computational demands. Here, we propose a correction based on the effective number of independent tests of interaction between marker pairs. This number depends on the effective number of independent single-marker tests. We tested its validity using simulated samples, as well as that of another correction of marker pair tests. We showed that our approach was valid while the other correction strongly underestimated the effective number of independent tests. Our method provides estimates of the effective number of independent tests close to those reported in the literature for a Genome-Wide Interaction Study on a 550K chip. Our correction method is quick and simple, and can be applied whatever the marker panel and the underlying linkage disequilibrium pattern.

Patients with rare PID diseases (like most non-PID patients and healthy individuals) carry, on average, 20,000 rare and common coding variants detected by high-throughput sequencing. It is thus a major challenge to select only a few candidate disease-causing variants for experimental testing. One of the tools commonly used in the pipeline for estimating a potential PID-candidate gene is to test whether the specific gene is included in the list of genes that were already experimentally validated as PID-causing in previous studies. However, this approach is limited because it cannot detect the PID-causing mutation(s) in the many PID patients carrying causal mutations of as yet unidentified PID-causing genes. In this study, we expanded in silico the list of potential PID-causing candidate genes from 229 to 3,110. We first identified the top 1% of human genes predicted by the human genes connectome to be biologically close to the 229 known PID genes. We then further narrowed down the list of genes by retaining only the most biologically relevant genes, with functionally enriched gene ontology biological categories similar to those for the known PID genes. We validated this prediction by showing that 17 of the 21 novel PID genes published since the last IUIS classification fall into this group of 3,110 genes (p < 10(-7)). The resulting new extended list of 3,110 predicted PID genes should be useful for the discovery of novel PID genes in patients.

Reference Genes for Quantitative Gene Expression Studies in Multiple Avian Species	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; TRANSCRIPTION-PCR DATA; REAL-TIME PCR; HOUSEKEEPING GENES; JAPANESE-QUAIL; NORMALIZATION; SELECTION; VALIDATION; GENOME; MODEL	Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) rapidly and reliably quantifies gene expression levels across different experimental conditions. Selection of suitable reference genes is essential for meaningful normalization and thus correct interpretation of data. In recent years, an increasing number of avian species other than the chicken has been investigated molecularly, highlighting the need for an experimentally validated pan-avian primer set for reference genes. Here we report testing a set for 14 candidate reference genes (18S, ABL, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT, PGK1, RPL13, RPL19, RPS7, SDHA, TFRC, VIM, YWHAZ) on different tissues of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), common crane (Grus grus), white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo f. domestica), cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), Humboldt penguin (Sphenicus humboldti), ostrich (Struthio camelus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), spanning a broad range of the phylogenetic tree of birds. Primer pairs for six to 11 genes were successfully established for each of the nine species. As a proof of principle, we analyzed expression levels of 10 candidate reference genes as well as FOXP2 and the immediate early genes, EGR1 and CFOS, known to be rapidly induced by singing in the avian basal ganglia. We extracted RNA from microbiopsies of the striatal song nucleus Area X of adult male zebra finches after they had sang or remained silent. Using three different statistical algorithms, we identified five genes (18S, PGK1, RPS7, TFRC, YWHAZ) that were stably expressed within each group and also between the singing and silent conditions, establishing them as suitable reference genes. In conclusion, the newly developed pan-avian primer set allows accurate normalization and quantification of gene expression levels in multiple avian species.

Gene amplification as a form of population-level gene expression regulation	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TRANSFERRED GENES; TIGHT REGULATION; GENOMIC ISLANDS; RECOMBINATION; DUPLICATIONS; PLASMIDS; NETWORKS; MUTATION	Experimental evolution in engineered Escherichia coli shows that amplification-mediated gene expression tuning, resulting from intrinsic instability of copy-number mutations, is a mechanism of gene expression regulation in fluctuating environments. Organisms cope with change by taking advantage of transcriptional regulators. However, when faced with rare environments, the evolution of transcriptional regulators and their promoters may be too slow. Here, we investigate whether the intrinsic instability of gene duplication and amplification provides a generic alternative to canonical gene regulation. Using real-time monitoring of gene-copy-number mutations in Escherichia coli, we show that gene duplications and amplifications enable adaptation to fluctuating environments by rapidly generating copy-number and, therefore, expression-level polymorphisms. This amplification-mediated gene expression tuning (AMGET) occurs on timescales that are similar to canonical gene regulation and can respond to rapid environmental changes. Mathematical modelling shows that amplifications also tune gene expression in stochastic environments in which transcription-factor-based schemes are hard to evolve or maintain. The fleeting nature of gene amplifications gives rise to a generic population-level mechanism that relies on genetic heterogeneity to rapidly tune the expression of any gene, without leaving any genomic signature.

These enzymes are widely distributed among plants and their presence has also been confirmed in several bacterial species. Recently, we reported for the first time in silico evidence of RIP encoding genes in metazoans, in two closely related species of insects: Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Here, we have experimentally confirmed the presence of these genes in mosquitoes and attempted to unveil their evolutionary history. A detailed study was conducted, including evaluation of taxonomic distribution, phylogenetic inferences and microsynteny analyses, indicating that mosquito RIP genes derived from a single Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) event, probably from a cyanobacterial donor species. Moreover, evolutionary analyses show that, after the HGT event, these genes evolved under purifying selection, strongly suggesting they play functional roles in these organisms.

J	Singh, B; Hasija, Y				Singh, Bharat; Hasija, Yasha			Analysis of osteoporosis gene interactome to identify heterogenic genes and pathways	NEW HORIZONS IN TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						GWAS; SNP; Osteoporosis; Interactome	POSTMENOPAUSAL CHINESE WOMEN; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; DISEASE-GENES; SOST GENE; NETWORK; POLYMORPHISMS; OSTEOBLASTS; CATENIN	Latest advances in genetics have prompted swift progress towards the efficient identification of genes tangled in complex diseases. Still, the comprehensive understanding of the relation between the physiological and molecular mechanism of genes and how they affect disease phenotypes remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians. Here, we wish to identify the osteoporosis disease module, i.e. the indigenous neighborhood of the interactome whose agitation is associated with osteoporosis, and endorse it for functional and pathophysiological application, using both computational and experimental methodologies. Recent studies in osteoporosis suggest that against certain genetic variations, the expression level of genes were different in both diseased and normal conditions. The osteoporosis disease module supplemented with uncertain GWAS p-values may also contain mechanisms that are collective with other disease modules. We, therefore, constructed the gene-gene and protein-protein interaction network for 104 genes with 173 reported SNPs accompanied by GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and recognized the substantial genes of osteoporosis along with their molecular functions. Our analyses exposed polymorphism in SOST and LRP5 as significantly conservative SNPs. Focal points: Benchside: Robust and concise curation of raw data for osteoporosis will help to make the presymptomatic data more valuable to perform wet lab studies. Bedside: Bioinformatics network studies are crucial in finding drug targets so it becomes necessary to process the huge data for osteoporosis to curate and produce significance targets. Further, unpredicted pathways and genes could be explored to support clinical studies. Industry: Data from disease network studies is essential for predicting clinical and non-clinical follow-ups for better drug development. Community: Ratification and standardization of redundant osteoporosis and gene polymorphism data helps to improvise clinical validation of drug targets. It is important that the data is upto the proper stringency level. Government: As for the ultimate purpose of drug development, refined gene expression data is the key in developing clinical products. Financial support from government to produce and validate such products is important as with time these will help both the patients and clinicians as well.

Yet, very few of such differentially expressed genes are detectably perturbed in individual patients. Here, we develop a framework to construct personalized perturbation profiles for individual subjects, identifying the set of genes that are significantly perturbed in each individual. This allows us to characterize the heterogeneity of the molecular manifestations of complex diseases by quantifying the expression-level similarities and differences among patients with the same phenotype. We show that despite the high heterogeneity of the individual perturbation profiles, patients with asthma, Parkinson and Huntington's disease share a broadpool of sporadically disease-associated genes, and that individuals with statistically significant overlap with this pool have a 80-100% chance of being diagnosed with the disease. The developed framework opens up the possibility to apply gene expression data in the context of precision medicine, with important implications for biomarker identification, drug development, diagnosis and treatment.

In this paper, we present a novel representation of S-system model, named restricted gene expression programming (RGEP), to infer gene regulatory network. A new hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on structure-based evolutionary algorithm and cuckoo search (CS) is proposed to optimize the architecture and corresponding parameters of model, respectively. Two synthetic benchmark datasets and one real biological dataset from SOS DNA repair network in E. coli are used to test the validity of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than previously proposed popular methods.

Onychophoran Hox genes and the evolution of arthropod Hox gene expression	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Development; Segmentation; Body patterning; Phylogeny; Tagmosis	DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; BURGESS SHALE; PANCRUSTACEAN PHYLOGENY; TERRESTRIAL CRUSTACEANS; TEMPORAL REGULATION; SEGMENT IDENTITY; VELVET WORMS; SISTER GROUP; BODY PLAN; ULTRABITHORAX	Introduction: Onychophora is a relatively small phylum within Ecdysozoa, and is considered to be the sister group to Arthropoda. Compared to the arthropods, that have radiated into countless divergent forms, the onychophoran body plan is overall comparably simple and does not display much in-phylum variation. An important component of arthropod morphological diversity consists of variation of tagmosis, i.e. the grouping of segments into functional units (tagmata), and this in turn is correlated with differences in expression patterns of the Hox genes. How these genes are expressed in the simpler onychophorans, the subject of this paper, would therefore be of interest in understanding their subsequent evolution in the arthropods, especially if an argument can be made for the onychophoran system broadly reflecting the ancestral state in the arthropods. Results: The sequences and embryonic expression patterns of the complete set of ten Hox genes of an onychophoran (Euperipatoides kanangrensis) are described for the first time. We find that they are all expressed in characteristic patterns that suggest a function as classical Hox genes. The onychophoran Hox genes obey spatial colinearity, and with the exception of Ultrabithorax (Ubx), they all have different and distinct anterior expression borders. Notably, Ubx transcripts form a posterior to anterior gradient in the onychophoran trunk. Expression of all onychophoran Hox genes extends continuously from their anterior border to the rear end of the embryo. Conclusions: The spatial expression pattern of the onychophoran Hox genes may contribute to a combinatorial Hox code that is involved in giving each segment its identity. This patterning of segments in the uniform trunk, however, apparently predates the evolution of distinct segmental differences in external morphology seen in arthropods. The gradient-like expression of Ubx may give posterior segments their specific identity, even though they otherwise express the same set of Hox genes. We suggest that the confined domains of Hox gene expression seen in arthropods evolved from an ancestral onychophoran-like Hox gene pattern. Reconstruction of the ancestral arthropod Hox pattern and comparison with the patterns in the different arthropod classes reveals phylogenetic support for Mandibulata and Tetraconata, but not Myriochelata and Atelocerata.

The Rpi genes hitherto explored are localized most often in clusters, which are similar between the diverse Solanum genomes. Their distribution is not independent of late maturity traits. This review provides a summary of the most recent important revelations on the genomic position and cloning of Rpi genes, and the structure, associations, mode of action and activity spectrum of Rpi and corresponding avirulence (Avr) proteins. Practical implications for research into and application of Rpi genes are deduced and combined with an outlook on approaches to address remaining issues and interesting questions. It is evident that the potential of Rpi genes has not been exploited fully.

J	Braun, R; Leibon, G; Pauls, S; Rockmore, D				Braun, Rosemary; Leibon, Gregory; Pauls, Scott; Rockmore, Daniel			Partition decoupling for multi-gene analysis of gene expression profiling data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROSTATE-CANCER; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; CLASS DISCOVERY; MICROARRAY; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; INFORMATION; ALGORITHM; SOFTWARE; NETWORK	Background: Multi-gene interactions likely play an important role in the development of complex phenotypes, and relationships between interacting genes pose a challenging statistical problem in microarray analysis, since the genes involved in these interactions may not exhibit marginal differential expression. As a result, it is necessary to develop tools that can identify sets of interacting genes that discriminate phenotypes without requiring that the classification boundary between phenotypes be convex. Results: We describe an extension and application of a new unsupervised statistical learning technique, known as the Partition Decoupling Method (PDM), to gene expression microarray data. This method may be used to classify samples based on multi-gene expression patterns and to identify pathways associated with phenotype, without relying upon the differential expression of individual genes. The PDM uses iterated spectral clustering and scrubbing steps, revealing at each iteration progressively finer structure in the geometry of the data. Because spectral clustering has the ability to discern clusters that are not linearly separable, it is able to articulate relationships between samples that would be missed by distance-and tree-based classifiers. After projecting the data onto the cluster centroids and computing the residuals ("scrubbing"), one can repeat the spectral clustering, revealing clusters that were not discernible in the first layer. These iterations, each of which provide a partition of the data that is decoupled from the others, are carried forward until the structure in the residuals is indistinguishable from noise, preventing over-fitting. We describe the PDM in detail and apply it to three publicly available cancer gene expression data sets. By applying the PDM on a pathway-by-pathway basis and identifying those pathways that permit unsupervised clustering of samples that match known sample characteristics, we show how the PDM may be used to find sets of mechanistically-related genes that may play a role in disease. An R package to carry out the PDM is available for download. Conclusions: We show that the PDM is a useful tool for the analysis of gene expression data from complex diseases, where phenotypes are not linearly separable and multi-gene effects are likely to play a role. Our results demonstrate that the PDM is able to distinguish cell types and treatments with higher accuracy than is obtained through other approaches, and that the Pathway-PDM application is a valuable technique for identifying disease-associated pathways.

We investigated the trends in gastrectomy and alcohol dehydrogenase-1B (ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) genotypes and their interactions in alcoholics. Methods: This survey was conducted on 4879 Japanese alcoholic men 40 years of age or older who underwent routine gastrointestinal endoscopic screening during the period 1996-2010. ADH1B/ALDH2 genotyping was performed in 3702 patients. Results: A history of gastrectomy was found in 508 (10.4%) patients. The reason for the gastrectomy was peptic ulcer in 317 patients and gastric cancer in 187 patients. The frequency of gastrectomy had gradually decreased from 13.3% in 1996-2000 to 10.5% in 2001-2005 and to 7.8% in 2006-2010 (P < 0.0001). ADH1B*1/*1 was less frequent in the gastrectomy group than in the non-gastrectomy group (age-adjusted prevalence: 20.4 vs. 27.6%, P = 0.006). ALDH2 genotype distribution did not differ between the two groups. The frequency of inactive ALDH2*1/*2 heterozygotes increased slightly from 13.0% in 1996-2000 to 14.0% in 2001-2005 and to 15.4% in 2006-2010 (P < 0.08). Two alcoholism-susceptibility genotypes, ADH1B*1/*1 and ALDH2*1/*1, modestly but significantly tended not to occur in the same individual (P = 0.026). The frequency of ADH1B*1/*1 decreased with ascending age groups. Conclusions: The high frequency of history of gastrectomy suggested that gastrectomy is still a risk factor for alcoholism, although the percentage decreased during the period. The alcoholism-susceptibility genotype ADH1B*1/*1 was less frequent in the gastrectomy group, suggesting a competitive gene-gastrectomy interaction for alcoholism. A gene-gene interaction and gene-age interactions regarding the ADH1B genotype were observed.

Thyroid cancer is usually asymptomatic at the initial stage, which makes patients easily miss the early treatment time. Combining genetic testing with imaging can greatly improve the diagnostic efficiency of thyroid cancer. Researchers have discovered many genes related to thyroid cancer. However, the effects of these genes on thyroid cancer are different. We hypothesize that there is a stronger interaction between the core genes that cause thyroid cancer. Based on this hypothesis, we constructed an interaction network of thyroid cancer-related genes. We traversed the network through random walks, and sorted thyroid cancer-related genes through ADNN which is fusion of Adaboost and deep neural network (DNN). In addition, we discovered more thyroid cancer-related genes by ADNN. In order to verify the accuracy of ADNN, we conducted a fivefold cross-validation. ADNN achieved AUC of 0.85 and AUPR of 0.81, which are more accurate than other methods.

Its polymorphism and expression may influence the occurrence of the disease. In order to study PRNP gene expression level in different ovine tissues, selection of reference genes is needed. Three housekeeping genes (RPL27, RPS29, OAZ1) were chosen for studying PRNP gene expression in ovine brain cortex, midbrain, cerebellum, brain stem, pituitary gland, spleen, liver, skeletal muscle and heart. The primers for gene sequencing were designed based on bovine reference sequences. RPL27 was found to be the most stable reference gene (for brain tissues M=0.322, SDCt=0.486, Stability Value=0.0089; for all tissues M=0.489, SDCt=0.696; Stability Value=0.0093). Regardless of the housekeeping gene, the expression level of PRNP was higher in brain tissues than in other tissues analyzed. A normalization experiment indicated that all candidate reference genes could be used as endogenous controls for studying PRNP mRNA expression in different ovine tissues. However, RPL27 seemed to be the most stable and appropriate for the experiment with many different tissue types and could be used as one of the reference genes for studying gene expression in ovine tissues. Our results confirmed that the PRNP gene is highly expressed in nervous tissue.

The aim of this study was to identify more novel genes for blood pressure. Based on the publically available SNP-based P values of a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, we performed an initial gene-based association study in a total of 69,395 individuals. To find supplementary evidence to support the importance of the identified genes, we performed GRAIL (gene relationships among implicated loci) analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, functional annotation clustering analysis, coronary artery disease association analysis, and other bioinformatics analyses. Approximately 22,129 genes on the human genome were analyzed for blood pressure in gene-based association analysis. A total of 43 genes were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction (P, 2.3 < 10(-6)). The evidence obtained from the analyses of this study suggested the importance of ID1 (P = 2.0 x 10(-6)), CYP17A1 (P = 4.58 x 10(-9)), ATXN2 (P = 1.07 x 10(-13)), CLCN6 (P = 4.79 x 10(-9)), FURIN (P = 1.38 x 10(-6)), HECTD4 (P = 3.95 x 10(-11)), NPPA (P = 1.60 x 10(-6)), and PTPN11 (P = 8.89 x 10(-10)) in the genetic basis of blood pressure. The present study found some important genes associated with blood pressure, which might provide insights into the genetic architecture of hypertension.

Given the sparse data on PD, we conducted a two-stage study to evaluate the genetic effects of VDR in PD. In the discovery stage, 30 tagSNPs in VDR were tested for association with risk as a discrete trait and age-at-onset (AAO) as a quantitative trait in 770 Caucasian PD families. In the validation stage, 18 VDR SNPs were tested in an independent Caucasian cohort (267 cases and 267 controls) constructed from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In the discovery dataset, SNPs in the 5' end of VDR were associated with both risk and AAO with more significant evidence of association with AAO (P = 0.0008-0.02). These 5' SNPs were also associated with AD in another study. In the validation dataset, SNPs in the 3' end of VDR were associated with AAO (P = 0.003) but not risk. The 3' end SNP has been associated with both MS and AD in previous studies. Our findings suggest VDR as a potential susceptibility gene and support an essential role of vitamin D in PD.

However, the evidence in support of single-gene speciation is sparse, mostly based upon single-gene mitochondrial studies and patterns of chiral variation between species. Previously, we used a theoretical model to show that as the chiral phenotype of offspring is determined by the maternal genotype, occasional chiral reversals may take place and enable gene flow between mirror image morphs, preventing speciation. Here, we show empirically that there is recent or ongoing gene flow between the different chiral types of Japanese Euhadra species. We also report evidence of mating between mirror-image morphs, directly showing the potential for gene flow. Thus, theoretical models are suggestive of gene flow between oppositely coiled snails, and our empirical study shows that they can mate and that there is gene flow in Euhadra. More than a single gene is required before chiral variation in shell coiling can be considered to have created a new species.

We sought to evaluate whether a reporter gene/probe system, namely the human estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (hERL)/16 alpha-F-18 fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (F-18-FES), could be used for monitoring vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression and response to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) therapy in ischemic heart disease. ANIMALS AND METHODS: Reporter gene hERL and therapeutic gene VE-GF165 were linked through internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and then the recombinant adenovirus vector Adenovirus 5-hERL-IRES-VEGF (Ad5-EIV) was constructed and transfected into MSCs, and named Ad5-EIV-MSCs. Rat myocardial infarction was induced by coronary arterial branch ligature, and Ad5-EIV-MSCs were transplanted by injection into the peripheral myocardium, while non-transfected MSCs transplantation used as controls. Fluorine-18-FDG micro-PET imaging was performed to confirm myocardial infarction 1 day after surgery. Fluorine-18-FES micro-PET/CT images were acquired 2 days after Ad5-EIV-MSCs transplantation. Myocardial specimens were obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining to verify the myocardial infarction. The expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and VEGF was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Rat myocardial infarction models were successfully produced and confirmed by H&E staining. Images of F-18-FDG PET showed obvious reduced or absent uptake of F-18-FDG on the infarct myocardium, while uniform and well-distribution on the normal myocardium. F-18-FES micro-PET/CT showed the tracer notable accumulated in the apical region where Ad5-EIV-MSCs were injected with an uptake value of 0.38 +/- 0.09%ID/g, which was much higher than that of surrounding normal myocardium with nearly no uptake of F-18-FES (0.10 +/- 0.03%ID/g, n=5, P<0.05). In the group of non-transfected MSCs, the apical uptake was similar to that of normal myocardium. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated positive expression of both ER and VEGF in the involved region accompanied by active angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that hERL/F-18-FES could be used as a reporter gene/probe system for monitoring gene and cell therapy in the ischemic heart disease.

Gene sharing between Epstein-Barr virus and human immune response genes	IMMUNOLOGIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Virome; Metagenome; Cytokine; Virokine; Altered-self; Microbiome	SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; SEVERE DRUG ERUPTIONS; RETROVIRUS HERV-K18 SUPERANTIGEN; NF-KAPPA-B; T-CELLS; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE; MOLECULAR MIMICRY; VIRAL-INFECTION; SOLAR-SYSTEM; BINDING-SITE	Epstein-Barr virus (also termed HHV-4, EBV), a component of the human virome or metagenome, is associated as a co-factor in many common human autoimmune diseases through epidemiologic evidence. Numerous EBV genes are functional as well as structural homologues of important immune response genes. For example, EBV-encoded BCRF1 is a functional homologue of IL-10, a critical cytokine regulator of immune tolerance. BZLF-1, an EBV-encoded transcription factor, contains regions with functional homology to both AP-1 and NF-kappa B DNA binding immune response regulatory factors. The author proposes a paradigm of "gene sharing" between viral- and host-encoded proteins as extension of molecular mimicry that has been largely overlooked in animal models that consider only host genomic factors rather than viral pathogens and the metagenome. Gene sharing may trigger chaotic behavior in human autoimmune disease through unstable feedback loops and perturbations of immune tolerance.

J	Ci, HP; Wu, N; Su, YJ				Ci, Haipeng; Wu, Nan; Su, Yanjie			Clock Gene Modulates Roles of OXTR and AVPR1b Genes in Prosociality	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CIRCADIAN-CLOCK; EVENING PREFERENCE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; DICTATOR GAME; POLYMORPHISM; OXYTOCIN; BEHAVIOR; ASSOCIATION; ADOLESCENTS; VASOPRESSIN	Background: The arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genes have been demonstrated to contribute to prosocial behavior. Recent research has focused on the manner by which these simple receptor genes influence prosociality, particularly with regard to the AVP system, which is modulated by the clock gene. The clock gene is responsible for regulating the human biological clock, affecting sleep, emotion and behavior. The current study examined in detail whether the influences of the OXTR and AVPR1b genes on prosociality are dependent on the clock gene. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study assessed interactions between the clock gene (rs1801260, rs6832769) and the OXTR (rs1042778, rs237887) and AVPR1b (rs28373064) genes in association with individual differences in prosociality in healthy male Chinese subjects (n = 436). The Prosocial Tendencies Measure (PTM-R) was used to assess prosociality. Participants carrying both the GG/GA variant of AVPR1b rs28373064 and the AA variant of clock rs6832769 showed the highest scores on the Emotional PTM. Carriers of both the T allele of OXTR rs1042778 and the C allele of clock rs1801260 showed the lowest total PTM scores compared with the other groups. Conclusions: The observed interaction effects provide converging evidence that the clock gene and OXT/AVP systems are intertwined and contribute to human prosociality.

J	Wang, YP; Tan, X; Paterson, AH				Wang, Yupeng; Tan, Xu; Paterson, Andrew H.			Different patterns of gene structure divergence following gene duplication in Arabidopsis	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Gene structure; Divergence; Transposed duplication; Whole-genome duplication; Selection; Arabidopsis	GENOME DUPLICATIONS; WHOLE-GENOME; FUNCTIONAL DIVERGENCE; EVOLUTIONARY FATE; EXPRESSION; SACCHAROMYCES; TETRAPLOIDY; POLYPLOIDY; ALIGNMENT; FAMILIES	Background: Divergence in gene structure following gene duplication is not well understood. Gene duplication can occur via whole-genome duplication (WGD) and single-gene duplications including tandem, proximal and transposed duplications. Different modes of gene duplication may be associated with different types, levels, and patterns of structural divergence. Results: In Arabidopsis thaliana, we denote levels of structural divergence between duplicated genes by differences in coding-region lengths and average exon lengths, and the number of insertions/deletions (indels) and maximum indel length in their protein sequence alignment. Among recent duplicates of different modes, transposed duplicates diverge most dramatically in gene structure. In transposed duplications, parental loci tend to have longer coding-regions and exons, and smaller numbers of indels and maximum indel lengths than transposed loci, reflecting biased structural changes in transposed duplications. Structural divergence increases with evolutionary time for WGDs, but not transposed duplications, possibly because of biased gene losses following transposed duplications. Structural divergence has heterogeneous relationships with nucleotide substitution rates, but is consistently positively correlated with gene expression divergence. The NBS-LRR gene family shows higher-than-average levels of structural divergence. Conclusions: Our study suggests that structural divergence between duplicated genes is greatly affected by the mechanisms of gene duplication and may be not proportional to evolutionary time, and that certain gene families are under selection on rapid evolution of gene structure.

For example, mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor ALR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans result in variable touch receptor neuron (TRN) function. Using single-molecule in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that this phenotypic variability reflects enhanced variability in the expression of the selector gene mec-3, which is needed, together with unc-86, for the differentiation of the TRNs. In a yeast expression system, ALR-1 enhances MEC-3/ UNC-86-dependent transcription from the mec-3 promoter, showing that ALR-1 can enhance bulk mec-3 expression. We show that, due to stochastic fluctuations, autoregulation of mec-3 is not sufficient for TRN differentiation; ALR-1 provides a second positive feedback loop that increases mec-3 expression, by restricting variability, and thus ensures TRN differentiation. Our results link fluctuations in gene expression to phenotypic variability, which is seen in many mutant strains, and provide an explicit demonstration of how variable gene expression can be curtailed in developing cells to ensure their differentiation. Because ALR-1 and similar proteins (Drosophila Aristaless and human ARX) are needed for the expression of other transcription factors, we propose that proteins in this family may act to ensure differentiation more generally.

For example, a key challenge of systems biology is to translate cellular heterogeneity data obtained from single-cell sequencing or flow-cytometry experiments into regulatory dynamics. We show how static population snapshots of covariability can be exploited to rigorously infer properties of gene expression dynamics when gene expression reporters probe their upstream dynamics on separate timescales. This can be experimentally exploited in dual-reporter experiments with fluorescent proteins of unequal maturation times, thus turning an experimental bug into an analysis feature. We derive correlation conditions that detect the presence of closed-loop feedback regulation in gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, we show how genes with cell-cycle-dependent transcription rates can be identified from the variability of coregulated fluorescent proteins. Similar correlation constraints might prove useful in other areas of science in which static correlation snapshots are used to infer causal connections between dynamically interacting components.

J	Zhang, WM; Li, SY; Liu, TY; Li, Y				Zhang, Wenmin; Li, Si Yi; Liu, Tianyi; Li, Yue			Partitioning gene-based variance of complex traits by gene score regression	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; HERITABILITY; ENRICHMENT; DISEASES	The majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci are not annotated to known genes in the human genome, which renders biological interpretations difficult. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) associate complex traits with genotype-based prediction of gene expression deriving from expression quantitative loci(eQTL) studies, thus improving the interpretability of GWAS findings. However, these results can sometimes suffer from a high false positive rate, because predicted expression of different genes may be highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium between eQTL. We propose a novel statistical method, Gene Score Regression (GSR), to detect causal gene sets for complex traits while accounting for gene-to-gene correlations. We consider non-causal genes that are highly correlated with the causal genes will also exhibit a high marginal association with the complex trait. Consequently, by regressing on the marginal associations of complex traits with the sum of the gene-to-gene correlations in each gene set, we can assess the amount of variance of the complex traits explained by the predicted expression of the genes in each gene set and identify plausible causal gene sets. GSR can operate either on GWAS summary statistics or observed gene expression. Therefore, it may be widely applied to annotate GWAS results and identify the underlying biological pathways. We demonstrate the high accuracy and computational efficiency of GSR compared to state-of-the-art methods through simulations and real data applications. GSR is openly available at.

With recent advances in transcriptomics and next-generation sequencing, co-expression networks constructed from RNA sequencing data also enable the inference of functions and disease associations for non-coding genes and splice variants. Although gene co-expression networks typically do not provide information about causality, emerging methods for differential co-expression analysis are enabling the identification of regulatory genes underlying various phenotypes. Here, we introduce and guide researchers through a (differential) co-expression analysis. We provide an overview of methods and tools used to create and analyse co-expression networks constructed from gene expression data, and we explain how these can be used to identify genes with a regulatory role in disease. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of other data types with co-expression networks and offer future perspectives of co-expression analysis.

Research efforts have focused on novel diagnostic technologies for this type of cancer. Transcriptomic microarray technology is a useful research strategy for investigating the molecular properties of CCA. The objective of the present study was to identify candidate biomarkers with high potential for clinical application in CCA using a meta-analysis-based approach. Gene expression profiles of CCA were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for integrated analysis. All differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were further constructed, hub proteins were identified and functional modules were extracted. Following integrated analysis of the seven eligible datasets (428 cases and 46 controls), a set of 1,080 DEGs was identified, including 710 upregulated and 370 downregulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that chromosome organization' was a significantly enriched GO term in the biological process category. DNA replication', influenza A', and lysosome' were the top three significantly enriched KEGG pathways. Furthermore, PPI network analysis indicated that the significant hub proteins were histone deacetylase 1, cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1, ubiquitin D, early growth response protein 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3. The majority of these proteins are involved in CCA. These results provided a set of targets that may help researchers to clarify further the underlying mechanisms of CCA tumorigenesis.

J	Liu, X; Wang, HL; Cui, YH				Liu, Xu; Wang, Honglang; Cui, Yuehua			Statistical Identification of Gene-gene Interactions Triggered By Nonlinear Environmental Modulation	CURRENT GENOMICS			English	Article						Associate study; Epistasis; Gene-gene-environment triple interaction; Nonlinear interaction; Varying coefficient model	MISSING HERITABILITY; EPISTASIS; MYSTERY; MODEL	Complex diseases are often caused by the function of multiple genes, gene-gene (GxG) interactions as well as gene-environment (GxE) interactions. GxG and GxE interactions are ubiquitous in nature. Empirical evidences have shown that the effect of GxG interaction on disease risk could be largely modified by environmental changes. Such a GxGxE triple interaction could be a potential contributing factor to phenotypic plasticity. Although the role of environmental factors moderating genetic influences on disease risk has been broadly recognized, no statistical method has been developed to rigorously assess how environmental changes modify GxG interactions to affect disease risk. To address this issue, we developed a GxGxE triple interaction model in this work. We modeled the environmental modification effect via a varying-coefficient model where the structure of the varying effect is determined by data. Thus the model has the flexibility to assess nonlinear environmental moderation effect on GxG interaction. Simulation and real data analysis were conducted to show the utility of the method. Our approach provides a quantitative framework to assess triple interactions hypothesized in literature.

However, not much work has considered the connection between gene functions and location of a gene's expression in the mammalian tissues. On the other hand, although unsupervised learning methods have been commonly used in functional genomics, supervised learning cannot be directly applied to a set of normal genes without having a target (class) attribute. Results: Here, we propose a supervised learning methodology to predict pair-wise gene functional similarity from multiplex gene expression maps that provide information about the location of gene expression. The features are extracted from expression maps and the labels denote the functional similarities of pairs of genes. We make use of wavelet features, original expression values, difference and average values of neighboring voxels and other features to perform boosting analysis. The experimental results show that with increasing similarities of gene expression maps, the functional similarities are increased too. The model predicts the functional similarities between genes to a certain degree. The weights of the features in the model indicate the features that are more significant for this prediction. Conclusions: By considering pairs of genes, we propose a supervised learning methodology to predict pair-wise gene functional similarity from multiplex gene expression maps. We also explore the relationship between similarities of gene maps and gene functions. By using AdaBoost coupled with our proposed weak classifier we analyze a large-scale gene expression dataset and predict gene functional similarities. We also detect the most significant single voxels and pairs of neighboring voxels and visualize them in the expression map image of a mouse brain. This work is very important for predicting functions of unknown genes. It also has broader applicability since the methodology can be applied to analyze any large-scale dataset without a target attribute and is not restricted to gene expressions.

In Silico Evolution of Gene Cooption in Pattern-Forming Gene Networks	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							CO-OPTION; DROSOPHILA SEGMENTATION; REGULATORY EVOLUTION; HOX PRO; CANALIZATION; ROBUSTNESS; MODEL; PRECISION; HOMOLOGY; ORIGIN	Gene recruitment or cooption occurs when a gene, which may be part of an existing gene regulatory network (GRN), comes under the control of a new regulatory system. Such re-arrangement of pre-existing networks is likely more common for increasing genomic complexity than the creation of new genes. Using evolutionary computations (EC), we investigate how co-option affects the evolvability, outgrowth and robustness of GRNs. We use a data-driven model of insect segmentation, for the fruit fly Drosophila, and evaluate fitness by robustness to maternal variability-a major constraint in biological development. We compare two mechanisms of gene cooption: a simpler one with gene Introduction and Withdrawal operators; and one in which GRN elements can be altered by transposon infection. Starting from a minimal 2-gene network, insufficient for fitting the Drosophila gene expression patterns, we find a general trend of coopting available genes into the GRN, in order to better fit the data. With the transposon mechanism, we find co-evolutionary oscillations between genes and their transposons. These oscillations may offer a new technique in EC for overcoming premature convergence. Finally, we comment on how a differential equations (in contrast to Boolean) approach is necessary for addressing realistic continuous variation in biochemical parameters.

Gene-gene interaction among cytokine polymorphisms influence susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis	GENES AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						aggressive periodontitis; cytochine genes; epistasis; genetic susceptibility; gene-gene interaction	GAMMA RECEPTOR POLYMORPHISMS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; CLINICAL EXPRESSION; RISK-FACTORS; GENOMIC DNA; ASSOCIATION; EPISTASIS; DISEASE; CLUSTER; MODULATION	Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) is a multifactorial disease. The distinctive aspect of periodontitis is that this disease must deal with a large number of genes interacting with one another and forming complex networks. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that gene-gene interaction may have a crucial role. Therefore, we carried out a pilot case-control study to identify the association of candidate epistatic interactions between genetic risk factors and susceptibility to AgP, by using both conventional parametric analyses and a higher order interactions model, based on the nonparametric Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction algorithm. We analyzed 122 AgP patients and 246 appropriate periodontally healthy individuals, and genotyped 28 polymorphisms, located within 14 candidate genes, chosen among the principal genetic variants pointed out from literature and having a role in inflammation and immunity. Our analyses provided significant evidence for gene-gene interactions in the development of AgP, in particular, present results: (a) indicate a possible role of two new polymorphisms, within SEPS1 and TNFRSF1B genes, in determining host individual susceptibility to AgP; (b) confirm the potential association between of IL-6 and Fc gamma- receptor polymorphisms and the disease; (c) exclude an essential contribution of IL-1 cluster gene polymorphisms to AgP in our Caucasian-Italian population.

The consequences of its inactivation in adult mice, and of the ensuing activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), have been explored mainly in a tissue-specific manner. This mid-gestation lethality can be also circumvented by using a floxed Vhl allele in combination with an ubiquous tamoxifen-inducible recombinase Cre-ERT2. Here, we characterize a widespread reduction in Vhl gene expression in Vhl(floxed)-UBC-Cre-ERT2 adult mice after dietary tamoxifen administration, a convenient route of administration that has yet to be fully characterized for global gene inactivation. Vhl gene inactivation rapidly resulted in a marked splenomegaly and skin erythema, accompanied by renal and hepatic induction of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, indicative of the in vivo activation of the oxygen sensing HIF pathway. We show that acute Vhl gene inactivation also induced Epo gene expression in the heart, revealing cardiac tissue to be an extra-renal source of EPO. Indeed, primary cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cardiac cells both induce Epo gene expression when exposed to low O-2 tension in a HIF-dependent manner. Thus, as well as demonstrating the potential of dietary tamoxifen administration for gene inactivation studies in UBC-Cre-ERT2 mouse lines, this data provides evidence of a cardiac oxygen-sensing VHL/HIF/EPO pathway in adult mice.

Epistatic analysis demonstrated that the rad31 mutation is an allele of the MEC1 gene, which allows further designation of the rad31 mutation as mec1-212. Mutation mec1-212, similar to deletion alleles of this gene, causes sensitivity to hydroxyurea, disturbs the check-point function, and suppresses UV-induced mutagenesis. However, this mutation significantly increases the frequency of spontaneous canavanine-resistance mutations induced by disturbances in correcting errors of DNA replication and repair, which distinguishes it from all identified alleles of gene MEC1.

Typical signs include microcephaly, dysmorphic features, short stature, small testes, and lean body build. Renpenning syndrome is caused by mutations in the polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) gene. Missense mutations, insertions, deletions, and duplications within the gene have been well-described. We present a 47-year-old male with clinical features resembling Renpenning syndrome. He has moderate intellectual disability, seizures since infancy, short stature, small testes, and dysmorphic features. Of note, our patient is normocephalic. A CT scan at 14 years of age showed cerebral atrophy. He had previously been verbally communicative and had few behavioral issues. Recently, our patient has regressed and has become uncommunicative, displaying little and unclear speech. He now exhibits memory and recognition loss and is uncooperative, aggressive, self-abusive, and incontinent. The reason for his regression within the past 4 years is unclear. SNP microarray analysis (500K) revealed a 4.7Mb duplication at Xp11.22-p11.23. Multiple ligation probe amplification (MLPA) of the PQBP1 gene contained within this duplicated region confirmed a duplication of the entire PQBP1 gene. Multiple other genes are duplicated within this 4.7Mb region and may contribute to his phenotype. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Bayzid, MS; Warnow, T				Bayzid, Md Shamsuzzoha; Warnow, Tandy			Gene tree parsimony for incomplete gene trees: addressing true biological loss	ALGORITHMS FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Gene duplication and loss; Gene tree parsimony; Deep coalescence; Dynamic programming	SPECIES TREE; ALGORITHMS; INFERENCE	Motivation: Species tree estimation from gene trees can be complicated by gene duplication and loss, and "gene tree parsimony" (GTP) is one approach for estimating species trees from multiple gene trees. In its standard formulation, the objective is to find a species tree that minimizes the total number of gene duplications and losses with respect to the input set of gene trees. Although much is known about GTP, little is known about how to treat inputs containing some incomplete gene trees (i.e., gene trees lacking one or more of the species). Results: We present new theory for GTP considering whether the incompleteness is due to gene birth and death (i.e., true biological loss) or taxon sampling, and present dynamic programming algorithms that can be used for an exact but exponential time solution for small numbers of taxa, or as a heuristic for larger numbers of taxa. We also prove that the "standard" calculations for duplications and losses exactly solve GTP when incompleteness results from taxon sampling, although they can be incorrect when incompleteness results from true biological loss.

While it had long been known that fundamental cellular processes, commonly referred to as housekeeping functions, are shared by animals and plants across the planet-processes such as the storage of information in genomic DNA, transcription, translation and the machinery for these processes, universal codon usage, and metabolic enzymes-Hox genes were different: mutations in these genes caused "bizarre" homeotic transformations of insect body parts that were certainly interesting but were expected to be idiosyncratic. The isolation of the genes responsible for these bizarre phenotypes turned out to be highly conserved Hox genes that play roles in embryonic patterning throughout Metazoa. How Hox genes have changed to promote the development of diverse body plans remains a central issue of the field of evo-devo today. For this Memorial article series, I review events around the discovery of the broad evolutionary conservation of Hox genes and the impact of this discovery on the field of developmental biology. I highlight studies carried out in Walter Gehring's lab and by former lab members that have continued to push the field forward, raising new questions and forging new approaches to understand the evolution of developmental mechanisms.

Here, we applied codon-based classification for 72 CCD genes from 35 plant species using hierarchical clustering analysis. The codon adaptation index (CAI) and relative codon bias (RCB) were utilized to estimate the level of gene expression. The codon-based cluster tree result shows neatly clustered subclass of CCD genes except BoCCD1 gene of Bixa orellana. Correlation analysis of CAI values with RCB indicates an overall low-level expression of CCD across different species. Similarly, the closeness in the codon cluster with same CAI values was not reflected in 3-D structural report of selected CCD genes. These finding not only enhances our insights into the classification of CCD gene across the species but also identifies the critical factors responsible for this variation, which could aid in prediction of gene expression and function for newly reported CCD genes.

In contrast, the genetic basis of allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been evaluated as extensively. It is well known that asthma is closely related with AR since a large proportion of individuals with asthma also present symptoms of AR, and patients with AR have a 5-6 fold increased risk of developing asthma. Thus, the relevance of asthma candidate genes as predisposing factors for AR is worth investigating. The present study was designed to investigate if SNPs in highly replicated asthma genes are associated with the occurrence of AR. Methods: A total of 192 SNPs from 21 asthma candidate genes reported to be associated with asthma in 6 or more unrelated studies were genotyped in a Swedish population with 246 AR patients and 431 controls. Genotypes for 429 SNPs from the same set of genes were also extracted from a Singapore Chinese genome-wide dataset which consisted of 456 AR cases and 486 controls. All SNPs were subsequently analyzed for association with AR and their influence on allergic sensitization to common allergens. Results: A limited number of potential associations were observed and the overall pattern of P-values corresponds well to the expectations in the absence of an effect. However, in the tests of allele effects in the Chinese population the number of significant P-values exceeds the expectations. The strongest signals were found for SNPs in NPSR1 and CTLA4. In these genes, a total of nine SNPs showed P-values <0.001 with corresponding Q-values <0.05. In the NPSR1 gene some P-values were lower than the Bonferroni correction level. Reanalysis after elimination of all patients with asthmatic symptoms excluded asthma as a confounding factor in our results. Weaker indications were found for IL13 and GSTP1 with respect to sensitization to birch pollen in the Swedish population. Conclusions: Genetic variation in the majority of the highly replicated asthma genes were not associated to AR in our populations which suggest that asthma and AR could have less in common than previously anticipated. However, NPSR1 and CTLA4 can be genetic links between AR and asthma and associations of polymorphisms in NPSR1 with AR have not been reported previously.

Identification of gene-gene interactions has been critically important in elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the variation of a phenotype. Regression models are commonly used to model the interaction between two genes with a linear product term. The interaction effect of two genes can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the true nature of the data. When nonlinear interactions exist, the linear interaction model may not be able to detect such interactions; hence, it suffers from substantial power loss. While the true interaction mechanism (linear or nonlinear) is generally unknown in practice, it is critical to develop statistical methods that can be flexible to capture the underlying interaction mechanism without assuming a specific model assumption. In this study, we develop a mixed kernel function which combines both linear and Gaussian kernels with different weights to capture the linear or nonlinear interaction of two genes. Instead of optimizing the weight function, we propose a grid search strategy and use a Cauchy transformation of the P-values obtained under different weights to aggregate the P-values. We further extend the two-gene interaction model to a high-dimensional setup using a de-biased LASSO algorithm. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method. Application to two case studies further demonstrates the utility of the model.

Here we study how gene regulatory network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can differ under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. To achieve this, we discretized the gene expression profiles and calculated the self-entropy of down-and upregulation of gene expression as well as joint entropy. Based on these quantities the uncertainty coefficient was calculated for each gene triplet, following which, separate gene logic networks were constructed for the aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Four structural parameters such as average degree, average clustering coefficient, average shortest path, and average betweenness were used to compare the structure of the corresponding aerobic and anaerobic logic networks. Five genes were identified to be putative key components of the two energy metabolisms. Furthermore, community analysis using the Newman fast algorithm revealed two significant communities for the aerobic but only one for the anaerobic network. David Gene Functional Classification suggests that, under aerobic conditions, one such community reflects the cell cycle and cell replication, while the other one is linked to the mitochondrial respiratory chain function.

Biological networks provide a knowledge scaffold against which the patterns and dynamics of omics data can be interpreted. The background information required for the construction of such networks is often dispersed across a multitude of knowledge bases in a variety of formats. The seamless integration of this information is one of the main challenges in bioinformatics. The Semantic Web offers powerful technologies for the assembly of integrated knowledge bases that are computationally comprehensible, thereby providing a potentially powerful resource for constructing biological networks and network-based analysis. Results: We have developed the Gene eXpression Knowledge Base (GeXKB), a semantic web technology based resource that contains integrated knowledge about gene expression regulation. To affirm the utility of GeXKB we demonstrate how this resource can be exploited for the identification of candidate regulatory network proteins. We present four use cases that were designed from a biological perspective in order to find candidate members relevant for the gastrin hormone signaling network model. We show how a combination of specific query definitions and additional selection criteria derived from gene expression data and prior knowledge concerning candidate proteins can be used to retrieve a set of proteins that constitute valid candidates for regulatory network extensions. Conclusions: Semantic web technologies provide the means for processing and integrating various heterogeneous information sources. The GeXKB offers biologists such an integrated knowledge resource, allowing them to address complex biological questions pertaining to gene expression. This work illustrates how GeXKB can be used in combination with gene expression results and literature information to identify new potential candidates that may be considered for extending a gene regulatory network.

One example of such models is the "gene gate model," which contains a minimal set of actors and kinetic parameters, which allows us to describe the regulation of a gene by both repression and activation. Based on this approach, we formulate a master equation for the case of a single gene regulated by its own product-a transcription factor-and solve it exactly. The obtained gene product distributions display features of mono-and bimodality, depending on the choice of parameters. We discuss our model in the perspective of other models in the literature.

Due to the computational complexity, most approaches for GRN reconstruction are limited on a small number of genes and low connectivity of the underlying networks. These approaches can only identify a single network for a given set of genes. However, for a large-scale gene network, there might exist multiple potential sub-networks, in which genes are only functionally related to others in the sub-networks. Results: We propose the network and community identification (NCI) method for identifying multiple subnetworks from gene expression data by incorporating community structure information into GRN inference. The proposed algorithm iteratively solves two optimization problems, and can promisingly be applied to large-scale GRNs. Furthermore, we present the efficient Block PCA method for searching communities in GRNs. Conclusions: The NCI method is effective in identifying multiple subnetworks in a large-scale GRN. With the splitting algorithm, the Block PCA method shows a promosing attempt for exploring communities in a large-scale GRN.

Its prognosis is influenced by a complex network of genetic interactions. In this study, we determined the potential key factors in the pathogenesis of this condition. Methods We constructed scale-free gene coexpression network using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The analysis was carried out on the GSE8586 dataset, which contains the expression profiles of umbilical cord tissue homogenates from 20 neonates with BPD and 34 unaffected controls. Results Our analysis identified one significantly downregulated coexpression module related to the BPD phenotype. It was significantly enriched in genes related to human T-cell leukemia virus infection and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this module, the expression of the following four hub genes in infants with BPD was significantly decreased: Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), BTG antiproliferation factor 2 (BTG2), Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). The downregulation of these hub genes was verified in clinical samples derived from blood and umbilical cord tissue. Conclusion The decreased expression of FOS, BTG2, JUN, and EGR1 is associated with BPD and, therefore, could be used as biomarkers to diagnose early BPD.

Methods Using the largest genotype dataset available for IBD (16,636 Crohn's disease (CD) and 12,888 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases) we analyzed G x G with the powerful case-only (CO) design. We studied 169 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for CD (156 for UC), previously shown to be associated with the respective diseases. To ensure the validity of the CO design, we confined our analysis to pairs of unlinked SNPs. We used principal component analysis at the center level to adjust for possible causes of genotypic association other than G x G, such as population stratification and genotyping batch effects. Results from center-wise logistic regression analyses were combined by a random effects meta-analysis. Results A number of nominally significant (p < .05) G x G interactions were observed, but none of these withstood the Bonferroni multiple testing correction. However, one SNP pair, comprising rs26528 in theIL27gene and rs9297145 in theKPNA7gene region was characterized by an interaction odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.10-1.27) for CD and ap-value of 7.75 x 10(-6). Owing to the concurrent role of theIL27andKPNA7genes in NF-kappa B signaling, a master regulator of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes in IBD, the observed interaction also has biological plausibility. Conclusions We were able to exemplify the utility of the CO design for analyzing G x G, but had to recognize that such interactions are probably scarce for IBD.

Characterizing bacterial gene circuit dynamics with optically programmed gene expression signals	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; LIGHT; ADAPTATION; FEEDBACK; YEAST; TIME	Gene circuits are dynamical systems that regulate cellular behaviors, often using protein signals as inputs and outputs. Here we have developed an optogenetic 'function generator' method for programming tailor-made gene expression signals in live bacterial cells. We designed precomputed light sequences based on experimentally calibrated mathematical models of light-switchable two-component systems and used them to drive intracellular protein levels to match user-defined reference time courses. We used this approach to generate accelerated and linearized dynamics, sinusoidal oscillations with desired amplitudes and periods, and a complex waveform, all with unprecedented accuracy and precision. We also combined the function generator with a dual fluorescent protein reporter system, analogous to a dual-channel oscilloscope, to reveal that a synthetic repressible promoter linearly transforms repressor signals with an approximate 7-min delay. Our approach will enable a new generation of dynamical analyses of synthetic and natural gene circuits, providing an essential step toward the predictive design and rigorous understanding of biological systems.

However, this approach encounters computational and statistical overfitting issues in higher dimensions. To address both concerns, we present an algorithm, which we term Isotonic Recursive Partitioning (IRP), for isotonic regression based on recursively partitioning the covariate space through solution of progressively smaller "best cut" subproblems. This creates a regularized sequence of isotonic models of increasing model complexity that converges to the global isotonic regression solution. The models along the sequence are often more accurate than the unregularized isotonic regression model because of the complexity control they offer. We quantify this complexity control through estimation of degrees of freedom along the path. Success of the regularized models in prediction and IRPs favorable computational properties are demonstrated through a series of simulated and real data experiments. We discuss application of IRP to the problem of searching for gene-gene interactions and epistasis, and demonstrate it on data from genome-wide association studies of three common diseases.

Essential regions for protein function are conserved among gene-family members, and genetic variants within these regions are potentially more likely to confer risk to disease. Here, we generated 2871 gene-family protein sequence alignments involving 9990 genes and performed missense variant burden analyses to identify novel essential protein regions. We mapped 2,219,811 variants from the general population into these alignments and compared their distribution with 76,153 missense variants from patients. With this gene-family approach, we identified 465 regions enriched for patient variants spanning 41,463 amino acids in 1252 genes. As a comparison, by testing the same genes individually, we identified fewer patient variant enriched regions, involving only 2639 amino acids and 215 genes. Next, we selected de novo variants from 6753 patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and 1911 unaffected siblings and observed an 8.33-fold enrichment of patient variants in our identified regions (95% C.I. = 3.90-Inf, P-value= 2.72 x 10(-11)). By using the complete ClinVar variant set, we found that missense variants inside the identified regions are 106-fold more likely to be classified as pathogenic in comparison to benign classification (OR = 106.15, 95% C.I = 70.66-Inf, P-value < 2.2x10(-16)). All pathogenic variant enriched regions (PERs) identified are available online through "PER viewer," a user-friendly online platform for interactive data mining, visualization, and download. In summary, our gene-family burden analysis approach identified novel PERs in protein sequences. This annotation can empower variant interpretation.

The aim of this study was to explore the regulation mechanism of UCP3 expression and provide a theoretical basis for the research of the function of porcine UCP3 gene in meat quality. Methods: Bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were used to analyze the methylation of UCP3 5'-flanking region and UCP3 mRNA expression in the adipose tissue or skeletal muscle of three pig breeds at different ages (1, 90, 210-day-old Putian Black pig; 90-day-old Duroc; and 90-day-old Dupu). Results: Results showed that two cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) islands are present in the promoter region of porcine UCP3 gene. The second CpG island located in the core promoter region contained 9 CpG sites. The methylation level of CpG island 2 was lower in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of 90-day-old Putian Black pigs compared with 1-dayold and 210-day-old Putian Black pigs, and the difference also existed in the skeletal muscle among the three 90-day-old pig breeds. Furthermore, the obvious changing difference of UCP3 mRNA expression was observed in the skeletal muscle of different groups. However, the difference of methylation status and expression level of UCP3 gene was not significant in the adipose tissue. Conclusion: Our data indicate that UCP3 mRNA expression level was associated with the methylation status of UCP3 promoter in the skeletal muscle of pigs.

A gene-disruption DNA construct containing a suitable antibiotic resistance marker gene is useful for the generation of gene-disrupted strains in bacteria. However, conventional construction methods, which require gene cloning steps, involve complex and time-consuming protocols. Here, a relatively facile, rapid, and cost-effective method for targeted gene disruption in Streptococcus mutans is described. The method utilizes a 2-step fusion polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate the disruption construct and electroporation for genetic transformation. This method does not require an enzymatic reaction, other than PCR, and additionally offers greater flexibility in terms of the design of the disruption construct. Employment of electroporation facilitates the preparation of competent cells and improves the transformation efficiency. The present method may be adapted for the generation of gene-disrupted strains of various species.

To date, there are no known effective strategies yet to combat WSSV infection. Hence, functional studies on genes critical for viral infection is essential in elucidating shrimp-virus interaction. Here we report the function of a gene from WSSV coding for a non-structural protein, VP9, utilizing RNA interference. Silencing of VP9 gene also effectively suppressed other gene region in the WSSV genome (wsvl 68 gene) as early as day 1 post infection (dpi). Three setups using Macrobrachium rosenbergii shrimp were prepared for treatment using VP9-dsRNA, GFP-dsRNA, and PBS. Each shrimp was challenge with WSSV, and survival rate was recorded. VP9- and GFP-dsRNA injected shrimps showed a significant survival rate of 80% and 70%, respectively, in contrast to 0% of the PBS injected shrimps at 25 dpi. Re-infection of shrimp survivors using a higher viral titer concentration, concurrent with the infection of new shrimp samples for the PBS control group, resulted in a significant 67%. survival rate for VP9-dsRNA compared to 0% with that of GFP-,dsRNA and PBS group. Challenge test on two more species, Penaeus monodon and Marsupenaeus japonicus, also significantly increased survival after VP9-dsRNA treatment. Our results provided evidence that VP9 gene plays an essential role in WSSV replication and it can be a potent target gene in the development of RNAi therapeutics for shrimps. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated xylose isomerase gene (xylA) diversity in three soil metagenomes differing in plant vegetation and geographical location, using an amplicon pyrosequencing approach and two newly-designed primer sets. A total of 158,555 reads from three metagenomic DNA replicates for each soil sample were classified into 1127 phylotypes, detected in triplicate and defined by 90% amino acid identity. The phylotype coverage was estimated to be within the range of 84.0-92.7%. The xylA gene phylotypes obtained were phylogenetically distributed across the two known xylA groups. They shared 49-100% identities with their closest-related XI sequences in GenBank. Phylotypes demonstrating <90% identity with known Xis in the database accounted for 89% of the total xylA phylotypes. The differences among xylA members and compositions within each soil sample were significantly smaller than they were between different soils based on a UniFrac distance analysis, suggesting soil-specific xylA genotypes and taxonomic compositions. The differences among xylA members and their compositions in the soil were strongly correlated with 16S rRNA variation between soil samples, also assessed by amplicon pyrosequencing. This is the first report of xylA diversity in environmental samples assessed by amplicon pyrosequencing. Our data provide information regarding xylA diversity in nature, and can be a basis for the screening of novel xylA genotypes for practical applications. 2015, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Event-based methods such as GRAPPA are very accurate but with extremely high complexity, while more recent methods based on gene adjacencies such as InferCARsPro is relatively faster, but often produces an excessive number of chromosomes. This issue is mitigated by newer methods such as GapAdj, however it sacrifices a considerable portion of accuracy. We recently developed an adjacency-based method in the probabilistic framework called PMAG to infer ancestral gene orders. PMAG relies on calculating the conditional probabilities of gene adjacencies that are found in the leaf genomes using the Bayes' theorem. It uses a novel transition model which accounts for adjacency changes along the tree branches as well as a re-rooting procedure to prevent any information loss. In this paper, we improved PMAG with a new method to assemble gene adjacencies into valid gene orders, using an exact solver for traveling salesman problem (TSP) to maximize the overall conditional probabilities. We conducted a series of simulation experiments using a wide range of configurations. The first set of experiments was to verify the effectiveness of our strategy of using the better transition model and re-rooting the tree under the targeted ancestral genome. PMAG was then thoroughly compared in terms of three measurements with its four major competitors including InferCARsPro, GapAdj, GASTS and SCJ in order to assess their performances. According to the results, PMAG demonstrates superior performance in terms of adjacency, distance and assembly accuracies, and yet achieves comparable running time, even all TSP instances were solved exactly. PMAG is available for free at http://phylo.cse.sc.edu.

The gene therapy has been acknowledged as the major progress of modem medicine, also a focus in the oncotherapy research. Commonly vectors of the gene therapy mainly include two categories, namely, viral vectors and nonviral vectors. Nanoparticles gene vector of various different kinds of materials, which belong to non-viral carriers. It presents excellent abilities of adsorption, concentration and protection of DNA, which can be attributed as a main reason of the adsorption and operation of nano-gene vector on exogenous genes. In this article, we mainly reviewed the recent studies of the characteristics of nanoparticles, characteristics and transport mechanism of nanoparticles as gene vector, the progress on nanoparticles as gene vector in tumor gene therapy. Nano-gene vectors, as new drug and gene carriers, present characteristics such as the controlled-release, targeting, and the improvement of bioavailability. Nanoparticles for cancer imaging and therapy have evolved rapidly during the last decade and it is expected that more and more will become clinical practise. In the near future, as a new nanometer gene delivery vector will be in medical research and treatment play a bigger role. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Forkhead Gene Family in Medaka: Expression Patterns and Gene Evolution	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article						Evolution; Expression pattern; Forkhead; Gene family; Medaka; Phylogenetic relationship; Zebrafish	TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; FOX GENES; GENOME	Using the genome sequence of the medaka, Oryzias latipes, we examined the genomic complement of Fox genes in this organism to gain insight into the evolutionary relationships and expression patterns of this gene family. We identified 31 Fox genes by searching for Forkhead domains in the medaka genome and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers designed from protein alignments. All the medaka Fox genes are encoded in 18 subclasses as follows: 5 Fox genes in subclass D; 3 Fox genes in subclass O; 2 Fox genes in each of subclass A, B, E, F, G, I, P, and Q, respectively; 1 Fox gene in each of subclass C, H, J, K, M, N, and R. The gene structures and general features are also discussed. In addition, we examined the expression patterns of some of these genes in different adult tissues and during embryonic development in medaka using quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. The present study shows that Forkhead transcription factors play an important role during early embryonic development in medaka, and the results will enhance our knowledge in terms of Fox family evolution in different taxa.

Dependencies of gene mutations on genetic background (i.e., epistasis) are believed to play a role in understanding molecular underpinnings of complex diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the process of identifying such interactions is complex due to for instance the curse of high dimensionality, dependencies in the data and non-linearity. Here, we propose a novel approach for robust and computationally efficient epistasis detection. We do so by first reducing dimensionality, per gene via diffusion kernel principal components (kpc). Subsequently, kpc gene summaries are used for downstream analysis including the construction of a gene-based epistasis network. We show that our approach is not only able to recover known IBD associated genes but also additional genes of interest linked to this difficult gastrointestinal disease.

New Bio-Marker Gene Discovery Algorithms for Cancer Gene Expression Profile	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Firefly; microarray; SVM; gene selection; bio-inspired; gene expression profile; hybrid-based algorithm	FEATURE-SELECTION ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	Several hybrid gene selection algorithms for cancer classification that employ bio-inspired evolutionary wrapper algorithm have been proposed in the literature and show good classification accuracy. In our recent previous work, we proposed a new wrapper gene selection method based-on firefly algorithm named FF-SVM. In this work, we will improve the classification performance of FF-SVM algorithm by proposed a newhybrid gene selection algorithm. Our newbiomarker gene discovery algorithm for microarray cancer gene expression analysis that integrates f-score filter method with Firefly feature selection method alongside with SVM classifier named FFF-SVM is proposed. The classification accuracy for the selected gene subset is measured by support vector machine SVM classifier with leave-one-out cross validation LOOCV. The evaluation of the FFF-SVM algorithm done by using five benchmark microarray datasets of binary and multi class. To show result validation of the proposed we compare it with other related state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiment proves that the FFF-SVM outperform other hybrid algorithm in terms of high classification accuracy and low number of selected genes. In addition, we compare the proposed algorithm with previously proposed wrapper-based gene selection algorithm FF-SVM. The result show that the hybrid-based algorithm shoe higher performance than wrapper based. The proposed algorithm is an improvement of our previous proposed algorithm.

Methods: Gene expression profile of GSE46750 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) package (Bioconductor project, http://www. bioconductor. org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma. html) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in inflamed OA samples. Gene Ontology function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed based on Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery data, and proteineprotein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. Regulatory network was screened based on Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. Molecular Complex Detection was used for sub-network screening. Two sub-networks with highest node degree were integrated with transcriptional regulatory network and KEGG functional enrichment analysis was processed for 2 modules. Results: In total, 401 up- and 196 down-regulated DEGs were obtained. Up-regulated DEGs were involved in inflammatory response, while down-regulated DEGs were involved in cell cycle. PPI network with 2392 protein interactions was constructed. Moreover, 10 genes including Interleukin 6 (IL6) and Aurora B kinase (AURKB) were found to be outstanding in PPI network. There are 214 up-and 8 down-regulated transcription factor (TF)-target pairs in the TF regulatory network. Module 1 had TFs including SPI1, PRDM1, and FOS, while module 2 contained FOSL1. The nodes in module 1 were enriched in chemokine signaling pathway, while the nodes in module 2 were mainly enriched in cell cycle. Conclusion: The screened DEGs including IL6, AGT, and AURKB might be potential biomarkers for gene therapy for OA by being regulated by TFs such as FOS and SPI1, and participating in the cell cycle and cytokineecytokine receptor interaction pathway.

Gene mutations were analyzed at the 211 locus of UGT1A1 (Gly71Arg) and 388 locus of OATP2 (Asn130Asp). The 226 enrolled infants were divided into high, moderate, and low risk subgroups according to American Academy of Pediatrics guideline. Blood samples of the enrolled infants were collected for the analysis of the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotypes and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms were compared in each group. Both UGT1A1 and OATP2 gene mutations occur more often in high risk group and moderate risk group than in low risk group. The results suggested that Gly71Arg and Asn130Asp mutations in UGT1A1 and OATP2 genes might be involved in the development of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.

Active recombinant Tol2 transposase for gene transfer and gene discovery applications	MOBILE DNA			English	Article						Tol2 transposase; hAT superfamily; Recombinant transposase protein; Zebrafish; Transposition site preference	TARGET SITE SELECTION; SLEEPING-BEAUTY; MEDAKA FISH; HUMAN-CELLS; T-CELLS; IN-VIVO; ZEBRAFISH; ELEMENT; PIGGYBAC; IDENTIFICATION	Background: The revolutionary concept of "jumping genes" was conceived by McClintock in the late 1940s while studying the Activator/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) system in maize. Transposable elements (TEs) represent the most abundant component of many eukaryotic genomes. Mobile elements are a driving force of eukaryotic genome evolution. McClintock's Ac, the autonomous element of the Ac/Ds system, together with hobo from Drosophila and Tam3 from snapdragon define an ancient and diverse DNA transposon superfamily named hAT. Other members of the hAT superfamily include the insect element Hermes and Tol2 from medaka. In recent years, genetic tools derived from the 'cut' and 'paste' Tol2 DNA transposon have been widely used for genomic manipulation in zebrafish, mammals and in cells in vitro. Results: We report the purification of a functional recombinant Tol2 protein from E. coli. We demonstrate here that following microinjection using a zebrafish embryo test system, purified Tol2 transposase protein readily catalyzes gene transfer in both somatic and germline tissues in vivo. We show that purified Tol2 transposase can promote both in vitro cutting and pasting in a defined system lacking other cellular factors. Notably, our analysis of Tol2 transposition in vitro reveals that the target site preference observed for Tol2 in complex host genomes is maintained using a simpler target plasmid test system, indicating that the primary sequence might encode intrinsic cues for transposon integration. Conclusions: This active Tol2 protein is an important new tool for diverse applications including gene discovery and molecular medicine, as well as for the biochemical analysis of transposition and regulation of hAT transposon/genome interactions. The measurable but comparatively modest insertion site selection bias noted for Tol2 is largely determined by the primary sequence encoded in the target sequence as assessed through studying Tol2 protein-mediated transposition in a cell-free system.

The studies of epistatic interactions of SNPs (denoted as gene-gene interactions or epitasis) are particularly important to unravel the genetic basis to complex multifactorial diseases. However, the greatest challenging and unsolved issue in GWAS is to discover epistatic interactions among large amount of SNPs data. Besides, traditional statistical approaches cannot solve such epistasis phenomenon due to possessing high dimensional data and the occurring of multiple polymorphisms. Hence, various kinds of promising software have been extensively investigated in order to solve these problems. This paper gives an overview on the software that had been used to detect gene-gene interactions that bring the effect on common and multifactorial diseases. Furthermore, sources, link, and functions description to the software are provided in this paper as well. Lastly, this paper presents the language implemented, system requirements, strengths, and weaknesses of software that had been widely used in detecting epistatic interactions in complex human diseases.

As a high throughput technology, gene trapping helped to generate tenth of thousands of ESC lines harboring mutations in single genes that can be used for making knockout mice. Ongoing international efforts operating under the umbrella of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC; www.knockoutmouse.org) aim to generate conditional alleles for every protein coding gene in the mouse genome by high throughput conditional gene targeting and trapping. Here, we provide protocols for gene trapping in ESCs that can be easily adapted to any other mammalian cell. We further provide protocols for handling and verifying conditional gene trap alleles in ESC lines obtained from the IKMC repositories and describe a highly efficient method for the postinsertional modification of gene trap alleles. More specifically, we describe a protein tagging strategy based on recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) that enables protein localization and protein-protein interaction studies under physiological conditions.

Airway oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between oxidative and antioxidative processes in the airways. There is evidence that chronic damage caused by oxidative stress may be involved in asthmatic inflammation and reduced lung function. Given their biological antioxidant function, the antioxidant genes in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family are believed to be associated with development and progression of asthma. This review aims to summarize evidence on the relationship between GST gene polymorphisms and asthma and interactions with environmental exposures. Recent Findings The current evidence on the association between GST genes and asthma is still weak or inconsistent. Failure to account for environmental exposures may explain the lack of consistency. It is highly likely that environmental exposures interact with GST genes involved in the antioxidant pathway. According to current knowledge, carriers of GSTM1(rs366631)/T1(rs17856199) null genotypes and GSTP1 Val105 (rs1695) genotypes are more susceptible to environmental oxidative exposures and have a higher risk of asthma. Some doubt remains regarding the presence or absence of interactions with different environmental exposures in different study scenarios. The GST-environment interaction may depend on exposure type, asthma phenotype or endotype, ethnics, and other complex gene-gene interaction. Future studies could be improved by defining precise asthma endotypes, involving multiple gene-gene interactions, and increasing sample size and power. Although there is evidence for an interaction between GST genes, and environmental exposures in relation to asthma, results are not concordant. Further investigations are needed to explore the reasons behind the inconsistency.

Eukaryote Genes Are More Likely than Prokaryote Genes to Be Composites	GENES			English	Article						composite genes; sequence similarity networks; odds ratio test	DATABASE; EVOLUTION; FUSION; FAMILIES; GENOMES; MODELS	The formation of new genes by combining parts of existing genes is an important evolutionary process. Remodelled genes, which we call composites, have been investigated in many species, however, their distribution across all of life is still unknown. We set out to examine the extent to which genomes from cells and mobile genetic elements contain composite genes. We identify composite genes as those that show partial homology to at least two unrelated component genes. In order to identify composite and component genes, we constructed sequence similarity networks (SSNs) of more than one million genes from all three domains of life, as well as viruses and plasmids. We identified non-transitive triplets of nodes in this network and explored the homology relationships in these triplets to see if the middle nodes were indeed composite genes. In total, we identified 221,043 (18.57%) composites genes, which were distributed across all genomic and functional categories. In particular, the presence of composite genes is statistically more likely in eukaryotes than prokaryotes.

J	Inoue, M; Horimoto, K				Inoue, Masayo; Horimoto, Katsuhisa			Relationship between regulatory pattern of gene expression level and gene function	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE; UBIQUITIN; DNA; DEGRADATION; SEQUENCE; COMPLEX; DRAFT; MAP; P53	Regulation of gene expression levels is essential for all living systems and transcription factors (TFs) are the main regulators of gene expression through their ability to repress or induce transcription. A balance between synthesis and degradation rates controls gene expression levels. To determine which rate is dominant, we analyzed the correlation between expression levels of a TF and its regulated gene based on a mathematical model. We selected about 280,000 expression patterns of 355 TFs and 647 regulated genes using DNA microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Based on our model, correlation between the expressions of TF-regulated gene pairs corresponds to tuning of the synthesis rate, whereas no correlation indicates excessive synthesis and requires tuning of the degradation rate. The gene expression relationships between TF-regulated gene pairs were classified into four types that correspond to different gene regulatory mechanisms. It was surprising that fewer than 20% of these genes were governed by the familiar regulatory mechanism, i.e., through the synthesis rate. Moreover, we performed pathway analysis and found that each classification type corresponded to distinct gene functions: cellular regulation pathways were dominant in the type with synthesis rate regulation and terms associated with diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease were dominant in the type with degradation rate regulation. Interestingly, these diseases are caused by the accumulation of proteins. These results indicated that gene expression is regulated structurally, not arbitrarily, according to the gene function. This funding is indicative of a systematic control of transcription processes at the whole-cell level.

Recently developed Gene Breaking Transposon (GBT) vectors greatly improve the fidelity and mutagenicity of transposon-based gene trap vectors. Results: We constructed and tested a bipartite GBT vector with Gal4-VP16 as the primary gene trap reporter. Our vector also contains a UAS:eGFP cassette for direct detection of gene trap events by fluorescence. To confirm gene trap events, we generated a UAS:mRFP tester line. We screened 270 potential founders and established 41 gene trap lines. Three of our gene trap alleles display homozygous lethal phenotypes ranging from embryonic to late larval: nsf(tpl6), atp1a3a(tpl10) and flr(tpl19). Our gene trap cassette is flanked by direct loxP sites, which enabled us to successfully revert nsf(tpl6), atp1a3a(tpl10) and flr(tpl19) gene trap alleles by injection of Cre mRNA. The UAS:eGFP cassette is flanked by direct FRT sites. It can be readily removed by injection of Flp mRNA for use of our gene trap alleles with other tissue-specific GFP-marked lines. The Gal4-VP16 component of our vector provides two important advantages over other GBT vectors. The first is increased sensitivity, which enabled us to detect previously unnoticed expression of nsf in the pancreas. The second advantage is that all our gene trap lines, including integrations into non-essential genes, can be used as highly specific Gal4 drivers for expression of other transgenes under the control of Gal4 UAS. Conclusions: The Gal4-containing bipartite Gene Breaking Transposon vector presented here retains high specificity for integrations into genes, high mutagenicity and revertibility by Cre. These features, together with utility as highly specific Gal4 drivers, make gene trap mutants presented here especially useful to the research community.

We hypothesized that hibernation, representing the closest natural mammalian phenomenon to death, would display similar gene expression profiles. Exploring zombie genes using qPCR and available transcriptomic resources from multiple torpid tissues in 13-lined ground squirrels showed little in common with gene profiles observed following death. Hibernators repress transcription, surviving only on the transcripts required during profound slowdowns of metabolic rate and of most physiological functions, therefore not requiring zombie gene expression that could be the cell's last resort during stress. This is the first study to explore zombie gene responses to a near-death situation in a living system.

Flowering pathways including photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellins, and autonomous pathway are regulated by different genes. Identification of flowering genes is essential for the development of bolting-resistant sugar beet cultivars. In this study, a set of 118 Arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in flowering time control were used as a reference to identify homologous counterparts in Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequence of sugar beet. Based on obtained ESTs, primers were designed for Suppressor of Frigida 4 (SUF4), Curly Leaf (CLF), Constitutive Photomorphogenesis1 (COP1), and Cycling Dof Factor (CDF) genes. SUF4 and CLF are components of vernalization pathway and COP1 and CDF are in photoperiod pathway. The sequence regions of these genes were amplified using cDNA PCR technique, and compared with other identified sequences in Gene Bank. Four genes namely CLF, COP1, CDF and SUF4 were deposited in Gene Bank. Results showed that most of the flowering pathway genes in Arabidopsis are detectable in sugar beet which can be contributed to the understanding of the genetic control of bolting resistance.

In the recent decade, the discovery of genetic markers for cancer prognosis obtains increasing attention and many methods have been developed. The 'element' methods use one or two independent genes to judge the Boolean status of disease. The 'set' methods use multiple gene markers as a whole to classify patients into different risks. And the advanced 'sets' methods use a group of different sets of biomarkers in an assembling manner. Either the existed 'set' or 'sets' methods only concern positive correlations among genes. However, the negative regulation, negative feedback, and functional repression are actually the relevant clues in cancer studies. Therefore, in this paper, based on the integrative gene expression data organised as gene-time-sample data or gene-sample-source data, we propose to mine Negatively Correlated Gene Sets (NCGSs) from multiple datasets, and use them along with the maximal positively correlated gene sets for prognosis classification. The experiment results suggest the promotions of cancer prognosis accuracy and meaningful pathogen relevance of gene markers by NCGS applications.

Incremental Fuzzy Mining of Gene Expression Data for Gene Function Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bioinformatics; fuzzy data mining; gene expression data analysis; gene function prediction; pattern discovery	PATTERNS; KNOWLEDGE; PROGRAM	Due to the complexity of the underlying biological processes, gene expression data obtained from DNA microarray technologies are typically noisy and have very high dimensionality and these make the mining of such data for gene function prediction very difficult. To tackle these difficulties, we propose to use an incremental fuzzy mining technique called incremental fuzzy mining (IFM). By transforming quantitative expression values into linguistic terms, such as highly or lowly expressed, IFM can effectively capture heterogeneity in expression data for pattern discovery. It does so using a fuzzy measure to determine if interesting association patterns exist between the linguistic gene expression levels. Based on these patterns, IFM can make accurate gene function predictions and these predictions can be made in such a way that each gene can be allowed to belong to more than one functional class with different degrees of membership. Gene function prediction problem can be formulated both as classification and clustering problems, and IFM can be used either as a classification technique or together with existing clustering algorithms to improve the cluster groupings discovered for greater prediction accuracies. IFM is characterized also by its being an incremental data mining technique so that the discovered patterns can be continually refined based only on newly collected data without the need for retraining using the whole dataset. For performance evaluation, IFM has been tested with real expression datasets for both classification and clustering tasks. Experimental results show that it can effectively uncover hidden patterns for accurate gene function predictions.	[Ma, Patrick C. H.; Chan, Keith C.

It contributes to create unique patters of DNA polymorphism within species and divergence between species. A typical pattern is so-called concerted evolution, in which the divergence between duplicates is maintained low for a long time because of frequent exchanges of DNA fragments. In addition, gene conversion affects the DNA evolution of duplicates in various ways especially when selection operates. Here, we review theoretical models to understand the evolution of duplicates in both neutral and non-neutral cases. We also explain how these theories contribute to interpreting real polymorphism and divergence data by using some intriguing examples.

A gene is generally annotated with several of these GO terms. Therefore, accurately predicting the association between genes and massive terms is a difficult challenge. To combat with this challenge, we propose an matrix factorization based approach called NMFGO. NMFGO stores the available GO annotations of genes in a gene-term association matrix and adopts an ontological structure based taxonomic similarity measure to capture the GO hierarchy. Next, it factorizes the association matrix into two low-rank matrices via nonnegative matrix factorization regularized with the GO hierarchy. After that, it employs a semantic similarity based k nearest neighbor classifier in the low-rank matrices approximated subspace to predict gene functions. Empirical study on three model species (S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, and A. thaliana) shows that NMFGO is robust to the input parameters and achieves significantly better prediction performance than GIC, TO, dRW-kN, and NtN, which were re-implemented based on the instructions of the original papers.

This involves genes and gene networks both as subjects and agents of cellular protection, creating difficulties in understanding. Here, we study how heating and cooling affect expression of single genes and synthetic gene circuits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We discovered that nonoptimal temperatures induce a cell fate choice between stress resistance and growth arrest. This creates dramatic gene expression bimodality in isogenic cell populations, as arrest abolishes gene expression. Multiscale models incorporating population dynamics, temperature-dependent growth rates, and Arrhenius scaling of reaction rates captured the effects of cooling, but not those of heating in resistant cells. Molecular-dynamics simulations revealed how heating alters the conformational dynamics of the TetR repressor, fully explaining the experimental observations. Overall, nonoptimal temperatures induce a cell fate decision and corrupt gene and gene network function in computationally predictable ways, which may aid future applications of engineered microbes in nonstandard temperatures.

The patients within metastatic ccRCC have a poor 5-year survival rate that is less than 10%. It is essential to identify ccRCC-related genes to help with the understanding of molecular mechanism of ccRCC. In this literature, we aim to identify genes related to ccRCC based on a gene network. We collected gene expression level data of ccRCC from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for our analysis. We constructed a co-expression gene network as the first step of our study. Then, the network sparse boosting approach was performed to select the genes which are relevant to ccRCC. Results of our study show there are 15 genes selected from the all genes we collected. Among these genes, 7 of them have been demonstrated to play a key role in development and progression or in drug response of ccRCC. This finding offers clues of gene markers for the treatment of ccRCC.

It uses novel reference network-based metrices for module evolution. These could be used to identify module of highly connected genes showing variation in co-expression network. In this study, a co-expression network-based approach was used for analyzing the genes from microarray data. Our approach consists of a simple but robust rank-based network construction. The publicly available gene expression data of Solanum tuberosum under cold and heat stresses were considered to create and analyze a gene co-expression network. The analysis provide highly co-expressed module of bHLH coding genes based on correlation values. Our approach was to analyze the variation of genes expression, according to the time period of stress through co-expression network approach. As the result, the seed genes were identified showing multiple connections with other genes in the same cluster. Seed genes were found to be vary in different time periods of stress. These analyzed seed genes may be utilized further as marker genes for developing the stress tolerant plant species.

A gene locus for targeted ectopic gene integration in Zymoseptoria tritici	FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Succinate dehydrogenase; Dominant selectable marker; Wheat pathogenic fungi; Septoria tritici blotch; Mycosphaerella graminicola	RED FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; SYSTEMIC FUNGICIDE CARBOXIN; RICE BLAST FUNGUS; USTILAGO-MAYDIS; MYCOSPHAERELLA-GRAMINICOLA; AGROBACTERIUM-TUMEFACIENS; SUCCINATE-DEHYDROGENASE; MONOMERIC RED; HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION; PLASMID CONSTRUCTION	Understanding the cellular organization and biology of fungal pathogens requires accurate methods for genomic integration of mutant alleles or fluorescent fusion-protein constructs. In zymoseptoria tritici, this can be achieved by integrating of plasmid DNA randomly into the genome of this wheat pathogen. However, untargeted ectopic integration carries the risk of unwanted side effects, such as altered gene expression, due to targeting regulatory elements, or gene disruption following integration into protein-coding regions of the genome. Here, we establish the succinate dehydrogenase (sdi1) locus as a single "soft-landing" site for targeted ectopic integration of genetic constructs by using a carboxin-resistant sdi1(R) allele, carrying the point-mutation H267L. We use various green and red fluorescent fusion constructs and show that 97% of all transformants integrate correctly into the sdi1 locus as single copies. We also demonstrate that such integration does not affect the pathogenicity of Z. tritici, and thus the sdi1 locus is a useful tool for virulence analysis in genetically modified Z. tritici strains. Furthermore, we have developed a vector which facilitates yeast recombination cloning and thus allows assembly of multiple overlapping DNA fragments in a single cloning step for high throughput vector and strain generation.

SSCs are adult stem cells that can both self-renew and differentiate. To maintain pluripotency, SSCs are regulated by both extrinsic factors secreted from surrounding somatic cells and intrinsic factors including specific gene expression programs. Using fluorescent labeled germ line stem cells, mouse gonocytes and SSCs were purified up to 97% by improved FACS method. Through microarray analyses, global gene expression profiles of gonocytes, SSCs, and differentiated cells were compared. A large number of distinctive genes were found to be enriched in respective cell populations, indicating different functional requirements of each cell type. Functional clustering analyses revealed that while gonocytes and SSCs preferentially express genes implicated in gene expression regulation and epigenetic modifications, differentiated cells including somatic cells are enriched with genes encoding proteins involved in various cellular activities. Further in situ hybridization and RT-PCR experiments confirmed SSC specific expression of several genes of which functions have not been characterized in SSCs. The comparative gene expression profiling provides a useful resource for gene discovery in relation to SSC regulation and opens new avenues for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying SSC self-renewal and differentiation. genesis 51:8396, 2013.

Immunological genes have received considerable attention in evolutionary biology as candidates for local adaptation and for studying functionally important polymorphisms. The normal structure and function of immunological genes will be distorted when they experience mutations leading to immunological dysfunctions. Results: Here, we examined the fundamental differences between the genes which on mutation give rise to autoimmune or other immune system related diseases and the immunological genes that do not cause any disease phenotypes. Although the disease genes examined are analogous to non-disease genes in product, expression, function, and pathway affiliation, a statistically significant decrease in evolutionary rate has been found in autoimmune disease genes relative to all other immune related diseases and non-disease genes. Possible ways of accumulation of mutation in the three steps of the central dogma (DNA-mRNA-Protein) have been studied to trace the mutational effects predisposed to disease consequence and acquiring higher selection pressure. Principal Component Analysis and Multivariate Regression Analysis have established the predominant role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in guiding the evolutionary rate of immunological disease and non-disease genes followed by m-RNA abundance, paralogs number, fraction of phosphorylation residue, alternatively spliced exon, protein residue burial and protein disorder. Conclusions: Our study provides an empirical insight into the etiology of autoimmune disease genes and other immunological diseases. The immediate utility of our study is to help in disease gene identification and may also help in medicinal improvement of immune related disease.

The objectives of this study are to annotate the gene sequence and compare the gene transcription levels among different bovine tissues based on our published microarray data. The gene transcribing the EST contains a 90-amino-acid protein sequence. The results of bioinformatic analyses using comparative genetics, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analysis and promoter sequence analysis indicated that this gene is a novel ELR + CXCL gene orthologous to mouse CXCL15. The gene is highly conserved in ruminants and exists in many other mammals but not in chickens, primates or pigs. Phylogenetic analysis and gene structures showed that CXCL15 is closer to CXCL8 than to other ELR+ CXCLs. Our microarray data show that bovine CXCL15 expression was higher in laser capture micro-dissected bovine pharyngeal epithelia than in the whole pharyngeal tissues, which agrees with the expression in mice. However, unlike the high expression in the mouse lung, our results showed that the bovine nasal turbinate, dorsal nasopharynx, dorsal soft palate and tongue expressed higher levels of CXCL15 than the lung and skins. Promoter analysis showed that ruminants have more immune-related transcription factor binding sites in the proximal promoters of CXCL15 than mouse. CXCL15 has previously only been reported in mice and has neutrophil chemotactic activity. Given the critical roles of neutrophils in innate immunity, this study provides useful information for further characterization of bovine CXCL15.

Gene Gangs of the Chloroviruses: Conserved Clusters of Collinear Monocistronic Genes	VIRUSES-BASEL			English	Article						gene gang; Chlorovirus; synteny; collinearity; monocistronic; gene neighborhood; functional annotation; operon; mosaicism; genomic island; genomic metabolon	STRUCTURAL CLASSIFICATION; SEQUENCES; EVOLUTION; OPERONS; SCOP	Chloroviruses (family Phycodnaviridae) are dsDNA viruses found throughout the world's inland waters. The open reading frames in the genomes of 41 sequenced chloroviruses (330 +/- 40 kbp each) representing three virus types were analyzed for evidence of evolutionarily conserved local genomic contexts, the organization of biological information into units of a scale larger than a gene. Despite a general loss of synteny between virus types, we informatically detected a highly conserved genomic context defined by groups of three or more genes that we have termed gene gangs. Unlike previously described local genomic contexts, the definition of gene gangs requires only that member genes be consistently co-localized and are not constrained by strand, regulatory sites, or intervening sequences (and therefore represent a new type of conserved structural genomic element). An analysis of functional annotations and transcriptomic data suggests that some of the gene gangs may organize genes involved in specific biochemical processes, but that this organization does not involve their coordinated expression.
