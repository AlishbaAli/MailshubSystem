Some human cancer cells have been reported to express PRRs. However, nucleic acid sensors in human cancers have not been studied in detail. Therefore, we systematically analyzed the expression, molecular cascade, and functions of TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, cGAS, and STING in human cancer cells. TLR3, TRIF, RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, and MAVS were expressed in 22 cell lines. The majority of cell lines responded to only RIG-I ligands 5 '-ppp-dsRNA, Poly(I:C)-HMW, Poly(I:C)-LMW, and/or Poly(dA:dT), as revealed by IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-beta secretion. IFN-beta secretion was inhibited by RIG-I and MAVS knockdown. cGAS and STING were co-expressed in 10 of 22 cell lines, but IFN-beta secretion was not induced by STING ligands ISD, HSV60, VACV70, Poly(dG:dC), and 3 ' 3 '-cGAMP in cGAS and STING intact cell lines. Further experiments revealed that the cGAS-STING pathway was activated, as revealed by TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-beta and ISG mRNA expression. These results suggest that human epithelial cancer cells respond to cytosolic RNA through the RIG-I-MAVS pathway but only sense cytosolic DNA through the cGAS-STING pathway. These findings are relevant for cancer immunotherapy approaches based on targeting nucleic acid receptors."

Moreover, upregulation of ITGBL1 enhanced cell mobility while silencing it exerted an opposite effect. Up-regulation of ITGBL1 significantly promoted phosphorylation of Akt, decreased the ratio of phosphorylated Akt in AGS/ITGBL1-shRNA and N87/ITGBL1-shRNA cells, enhanced cell mobility and proliferation.

Essential oil were extracted from Tagetes erecta flowers and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For observing a protective effect against MNNG induced gastric cancer, we divided rats into 4 groups (group A to D) having 10 rats in each group. Performed various experiments and measured a different parameters to investigate antioxidant activity, immune response, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity. The levels of malondialdehyde were markedly increased in the presence of N-methyl-NMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEnitro-N-nitroguanidine, whereas, the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase, and catalase were lowered in the treated rats in contrast with the control. Intervention with TEEO to gastric cancer-induced rats upregulated the redox status and the activity of the immune system to decrease cancer risk. The proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) secretions that were induced by MNNG were markedly inhibited by TEEO. Administration of TEEO also significantly reduced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling positive gastric cancer cells, expression of mRNA of caspase-3, and Bax. Whereas, the expression of Bcl-2 was increased. Additionally, downregulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 expression in tissues of the stomach of MNNG-induced-rats were markedly elevated due to TEEO.

Despite the clinical benefits, ADT is associated with multiple adverse effects including fatigue. The goal of the study was to examine metabolomic changes to better understand cancer-related fatigue specific to ADT treatment. Methods A total of 160 plasma samples collected from participants with (+ADT, n = 58) or without neoadjuvant ADT (-ADT, n = 102) prior to radiation therapy for treatment of non-metastatic localized prostate cancer were included in the study. Fatigue and sleep-related impairment were measured using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Plasma metabolites were identified and measured using untargeted ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry metabolomics analyses. Partial least square discriminant analysis was used to identify discriminant metabolite features, and the diagnostic performance of selected classifiers was quantified using AUROC curve analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using metabolite sets enrichment analyses. Findings Steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways, including androstenedione metabolism as well as androgen and estrogen metabolism, were overrepresented by metabolites that significantly discriminated samples in the +ADT from the -ADT group. Additional overrepresented metabolic pathways included amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and carnitine synthesis. Of the metabolites that were significantly different between the groups, steroid hormone biosynthesis metabolites were most significantly correlated with fatigue severity. Sleep-related impairment was strongly correlated with fatigue severity and inversely correlated with ADT-induced reduction in androsterone sulfate. Conclusions Patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving neoadjuvant ADT prior to radiation therapy reported relatively more severe fatigue. Increased fatigue in this population may be attributable to sleep-related impairment associated with alterations in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Findings in this study provide a basis for further research of changes in sleep patterns and their role in this specific subcategory of cancer-related fatigue caused by the treatment."

Precisely defining the biological role of AMPK necessitates the availability of a potent and selective inhibitor. Methods High-throughput screening and chemical optimization were performed to identify a novel AMPK inhibitor. Cell proliferation and mechanistic assays, as well as gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to investigate the cellular impact as well as the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and androgen signaling in prostate cancer models. Also, fatty acid turnover was determined by examining lipid droplet formation. Results We identified BAY-3827 as a novel and potent AMPK inhibitor with additional activity against ribosomal 6 kinase (RSK) family members. It displays strong anti-proliferative effects in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. Analysis of genes involved in AMPK signaling revealed that the expression of those encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), all of which are involved in lipid metabolism, was strongly upregulated by androgen in responsive models. Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified several androgen receptor (AR) binding peaks in the HMGCR and PFKFB2 genes. BAY-3827 strongly down-regulated the expression of lipase E (LIPE), cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) and serine-threonine kinase AKT3 in responsive prostate cancer cell lines. Also, the expression of members of the carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1 (CPT1) family was inhibited by BAY-3827, and this was paralleled by impaired lipid flux. Conclusions The availability of the potent inhibitor BAY-3827 will contribute to a better understanding of the role of AMPK signaling in cancer, especially in prostate cancer."

Metabolic and Immunological Subtypes of Esophageal Cancer Reveal Potential Therapeutic Opportunities	FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						metabolic subtypes; immunological subtypes; esophageal cancer; cancer metabolism; biomarkers	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMAS; KAPPA-B; GENE-EXPRESSION; COMPLEX I; HYPOXIA; ACTIVATION; CHECKPOINT; PROGNOSIS; CHEMORADIOTHERAPY; ADENOCARCINOMAS	"Background Esophageal cancer has the sixth highest rate of cancer-associated deaths worldwide, with many patients displaying metastases and chemotherapy resistance. We sought to find subtypes to see if precision medicine could play a role in finding new potential targets and predicting responses to therapy. Since metabolism not only drives cancers but also serves as a readout, metabolism was examined as a key reporter for differences. Methods Unsupervised and supervised classification methods, including hierarchical clustering, partial least squares discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and machine learning techniques, were used to discover and display two major subgroups. Genes, pathways, gene ontologies, survival, and immune differences between the groups were further examined, along with biomarkers between the groups and against normal tissue. Results Esophageal cancer had two major unique metabolic profiles observed between the histological subtypes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The metabolic differences suggest that ESCC depends on glycolysis, whereas EAC relies more on oxidative metabolism, catabolism of glycolipids, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the electron transport chain. We also noted a robust prognostic risk associated with COQ3 expression. In addition to the metabolic alterations, we noted significant alterations in key pathways regulating immunity, including alterations in cytokines and predicted immune infiltration. ESCC appears to have increased signature associated with dendritic cells, Th17, and CD8 T cells, the latter of which correlate with survival in ESCC. We bioinformatically observed that ESCC may be more responsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy than EAC and postulate targets to enhance therapy further. Lastly, we highlight correlations between differentially expressed enzymes and the potential immune status. Conclusion Overall, these results highlight the extreme differences observed between the histological subtypes and may lead to novel biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, and differences in therapeutic response for targeting each esophageal cancer subtype."

The objective of this study was to discuss the effect of HDAC3/microRNA130a-3p (miR-130a-3p)/high-mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) on immune escape of breast cancer. Methods: HDAC3, miR-130a-3p and HMGB3 expression in breast cancer tissues and cells were tested, and the correlation between HDAC3, miR-130a-3p and HMGB3 was analyzed. CD8, CD69 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression was detected. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with relative plasmid of HDAC3 or miR-130a-3p to test cell viability, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis in MDAMB-231 cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cells in MDA-MB-231 cells was tested, and CD8+/ CD69+/PD-1+T cell proliferation and apoptosis before and after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells were detected. Results: HDAC3 and HMGB3 expression were raised and miR-130a-3p expression was diminished in breast cancer tissues and cells. HDAC3 was negatively correlated with miR-130a-3p while miR-130a-3p was negatively correlated with HMGB3. Down-regulating HDAC3 or up-regulating miR-130a-3p restrained cell viability, migration, EMT and anti-CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cytotoxicity and facilitated apoptosis of breast cancer cells. HDAC3 regulated HMGB3 by mediating miR-130a-3p expression. Down-regulating miR-130a-3p reversed the role of HDAC3 reduction on breast cancer cells. HDAC3 regulated CD8+/CD69+/PD-1+T cell proliferation and apoptosis by mediating miR-130a-3p. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that HDAC3 increases HMGB3 expression to promote the immune escape of breast cancer cells via down-regulating miR-130a-3p."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis, metastasis and progression of BC. Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) oncogenic transcription factor is involved in events considered as hallmarks of cancer. However, the specific mechanism by which FOXM1 exerts its oncogenic effects remains unclear and little is known about its effects on the regulation of miRNA expression. We have found that FOXM1 is upregulated in breast cancer cells and that its expression is associated with shortened overall survival and poor prognosis in patients with BC. Using microarray technology, we assessed the expression profiles of 752 miRNAs in highly aggressive and metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in response to FOXM1 knockdown and identified 13 differentialy expressed miRNAs (3 miRNAs upregulated and 10 miRNAs down-regulated). We validated the results of the miRNA expression profile in two different TNBC cells by performing qRT-PCR and identified that miR-186-5p and miR-200b-5p were consistently down- or upregulated, respectively, after knockdown of FOXM1. We further performed KEGG pathway analysis and GO enrichment analysis for miR-186-5p and miR-200b-5p, and identified that these miRNAs are associated with cancer development and progression involving toll-like receptor signaling, cell cycle, AMPK, p53 and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Taken together, our results suggest that increased FOXM1 expression is associated with poor patient survival and leads to induction of oncomiR miR-186-5p expression and tumor-suppressor inhibition miR200b-5p, suggesting that the FOXM1/miRNA signaling pathway may contribute to poor patient prognosis and may be a potential therapeutic target in TNBC."

However, the role of Tim-3/Galectin-9 pathway in the immune evasion of cervical cancer remains unknown. This study is to investigate the expression, function, and regulation of Tim-3/Galectin-9 signaling pathway in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive cervical cancer. Flow cytometry showed that Tim-3 expression on T cell and Galectin-9 expression on monocytes in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly higher compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and benign uterine fibroids Tim-3 + CD4+ Th1 cells and Tim-3 + CD8+ T cells in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly reduced after surgery. Serum TGF-beta and IL-10 levels were positively correlated with Tim-3 + Treg cells, while IFN-gamma and IL-2 were negatively correlated with Tim-3 + Th1 cells. Additionally, Tim-3 + CD4+ T cells were positively correlated with Galectin-9 + monocytes. Survival curve analysis showed that Tim-3 + CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with patient survival, and closely related to FIGO stage, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis of HPV positive cervical cancer. In vitro experiments showed that by blocking the Tim-3/Galectin-9 pathway, the proliferation of T cells and their ability to express IFN-gamma, IL-2, perforin, and granzyme B was significantly restored. In conclusion, high levels of Tim-3 and Galectin-9 in HPV positive cervical cancer patients play roles in the progression of disease by promoting Treg cells to inhibit the cytotoxic function of Th1 and CD8+ T cells. Tim-3/Galectin-9 may serve as a new immunotherapy target for patients with HPV positive cervical cancer."

Mainly secreted by bone cells, FGF23 acts as a hormone on the kidney, stimulating phosphate excretion and suppressing formation of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3, active vitamin D. These effects are dependent on transmembrane protein alpha Klotho, which enhances the binding affinity of FGF23 for FGF receptors (FGFR). Locally produced FGF23 in other tissues including liver or heart exerts further paracrine effects without involvement of alpha Klotho. Soluble Klotho (sKL) is an endocrine factor that is cleaved off of transmembrane Klotho or generated by alternative splicing and regulates membrane channels, transporters, and intracellular signaling including insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and Wnt pathways, signaling cascades highly relevant for tumor progression. In mice, lack of FGF23 or alpha Klotho results in derangement of phosphate metabolism and a syndrome of rapid aging with abnormalities affecting most organs and a very short life span. Conversely, overexpression of anti-aging factor alpha Klotho results in a profound elongation of life span. Accumulating evidence suggests a major role of alpha Klotho as a tumor suppressor, at least in part by inhibiting IGF-1 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Hence, in many malignancies, higher alpha Klotho expression or activity is associated with a more favorable outcome. Moreover, also FGF23 and phosphate have been revealed to be factors relevant in cancer. FGF23 is particularly significant for those forms of cancer primarily affecting bone (e.g., multiple myeloma) or characterized by bone metastasis. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the significance of FGF23 and alpha Klotho for tumor cell signaling, biology, and clinically relevant parameters in different forms of cancer."

Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) inhibits immune cell function. However, only few reports described the mechanism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of immune escape regulated by GDF-15 in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer patients and healthy women were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were performed to measure GDF-15 expression. Immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and co-immunoprecipitation assay were used to evaluate the interaction between GDF-15 and the surface molecules of DCs. Immunofluorescence analysis, flow cytometry and transwell assay were used to evaluate additional effects of GDF-15 on DCs. The results showed that GDF-15 expression was higher in the ovarian cancer patients compared to that in the healthy women. The TIMER algorithm revealed that highly GDF-15 expression is associated with immune DC infiltration in immunoreactive high-grade serous carcinoma. A further study showed that GDF-15 suppressed DCs maturation, as well as IL-12p40 and TNF-alpha secretion, the length and number of protrusions and the migration. More importantly, CD44 in the surface of DCs interacted with GDF-15. The overexpression of CD44 in DCs resulted in the suppression of the inhibitory effect of GDF-15 on the length and number of DC synapses. In DCs overexpressing CD44 the inhibition of GDF-15 on the expression of CD11c, CD83 and CD86 was decreased, while in DCs with a knockdown of CD44 the inhibition was further enhanced. Knockdown of CD44 in DCs enhanced the inhibitory effect of GDF-15 on DC migration, while the overexpression of CD44 inhibited the inhibitory effect of GDF-15 on DC migration. In conclusion, the present study suggested that GDF-15 might facilitate ovarian cancer immune escape by interacting with CD44 in DCs to inhibit their function."

However, little is known about the underlying mechanism. In this study, we investigated the potential role and mechanisms of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in CAFs-induced malignancy and gemcitabine resistance. We demonstrated that ATF4 is overexpressed in PDAC and associated with a poor prognosis. Silencing ATF4 expression decreased proliferation, colony formation, migration, gemcitabine sensitivity, and sphere formation. Subsequently, we revealed that CAFs secrete TGF-beta 1 to upregulate the expression of ATF4 in PDAC cells via the SMAD2/3 pathway and induce cancer progression, cancer stemness, and gemcitabine resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ATF4 directly binds to the ABCC1 promoter region to activate transcription. In summary, these data demonstrate that CAFs contribute to malignancy and gemcitabine resistance in PDAC by upregulating the expression of ATF4 via the TGF-beta 1/SMAD2/3 axis and highlight that ATF4 is an attractive therapeutic target for combating gemcitabine resistance in PDAC."

The quantity and cross-linking status of ECM components are major factors determining tissue stiffness. During tumorigenesis, the interplay between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) often results in the stiffness of the ECM, leading to aberrant mechanotransduction and further malignant transformation. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of ECM dysregulation in the TME would contribute to the discovery of promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Herein, we summarized the knowledge concerning the following: (1) major ECM constituents and their functions in both normal and malignant conditions; (2) the interplay between cancer cells and the ECM in the TME; (3) key receptors for mechanotransduction and their alteration during carcinogenesis; and (4) the current therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant ECM for cancer treatment."

However, the role of commensal fungi in colon cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we report that mice lacking the c-type lectin Dectin-3 (Dectin-3(-/-)) show increased tumorigenesis and Candida albicans burden upon chemical induction. Elevated C. albicans load triggered glycolysis in macrophages and interleukin-7 (IL-7) secretion. IL-7 induced IL-22 production in ROR gamma t(+) (group 3) innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) via aryl hydrocarbon receptor and STAT3. Consistently, IL-22 frequency in tumor tissues of colon cancer patients positively correlated with fungal burden, indicating the relevance of this regulatory axis in human disease. These results establish a C. albicans-driven crosstalk between macrophages and innate lymphoid cells in the intestine and expand our understanding on how commensal mycobiota regulate host immunity and promote tumorigenesis."

Moreover, global gene expression analysis revealed several genes that were differently expressed in our co-culture models with the overexpression of GLIPR1 and SPARC potentially representing a molecular signature associated with the invasion of central nervous system by prostate malignant cells.

Transcriptomic/proteomic analyses identified 10273 mRNAs and 821 proteins in microplasts. Interestingly, 377 microplast mRNAs coded for corresponding microplast proteins. Microplast mRNAs and proteins were mainly associated with binding and catalytic activities. Microplasts showed enrichment of mRNAs involved in transcription regulation and proteins involved in processes such as cell-cell adhesion and translation.

Here we unexpectedly find a strikingly positive correlation between CMTM6 and Hu-Antigen R (HuR) expression in most types of cancer. Mechanistically, we elucidate HuR stabilizes CMTM6 mRNA via direct association with AU-rich elements (AREs) in its 3 ' UTR and predominantly up-regulates CMTM6, which is readily abolished by HuR-specific inhibitor, MS-444. Phenotypically, we notice abundant cell surface PD-L1 in HuR-high cancer cells, which significantly inhibits immune activation of co-cultured T cells as indicated by IL-2 production. Treatment with MS-444 completely relieves immune suppression imposed by HuR-overexpression and further stimulates immune responses.

TNF alpha is such a pleiotropic cytokine, which involves maintaining a plethora of immune responses. Initially, TNF alpha is synthesized as a 26 kDa full-length transmembrane form, which is enzymatically cleaved to produce the soluble circulating 17 kDa TNF alpha. Although the anti-cancer potential of soluble TNF alpha was discovered more than a century back, its dual ability to promote tumor, posed a major hindrance in finding its acceptance as a proper anti-cancer molecule. In contrast, the membrane-tethered tmTNF alpha holds the potential of tumor regression without initiating cell proliferation. The membrane-tethered form of TNF alpha is the physiological precursor of soluble TNF alpha that remains biologically active and is capable of initiating signaling cascades after binding with the TNF alpha receptors TNFR I and TNFR II. In this review, we emphasize on the basic biology and molecular aspects of tmTNF alpha for its anti-cancer potential."

We analyzed 65,000 distinct compounds by means of a phenotypic discovery platform for autophagy induction and identified the IGF1R (insulin like growth factor 1 receptor) inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) as a potent inducer of autophagic flux. We found that PPP acts on-target, as an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF1R and enhances the release of adenosine triphosphate, ATP, from stressed and dying cancer cells in vitro, thereby improving the therapeutic efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in cancer-bearing mice. This PPP effect was phenocopied by another IGF1R inhibitor, linsitinib. Moreover, in human triple-negative breast cancer, phosphorylation of IGF1R correlates with reduced autophagy, an unfavorable local immune profile and poor prognosis. In summary, IGF1R inhibition may constitute a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer in the context of chemoimmunotherapy."

Long noncoding RNAs are emerging as regulators of DNA damage and radioresistance. LINC-PINT was originally identified as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. In this study, LINC-PINT was significantly downregulated in nasopharyngeal cancer tissues than in rhinitis tissues, and low LINC-PINT expressions showed poorer prognosis in patients who received radiotherapy. We further identified a functional role of LINC-PINT in inhibiting the malignant phenotypes and sensitizing cancer cells to irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC-PINT was responsive to DNA damage, inhibiting DNA damage repair through ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 signaling pathways. Moreover, LINC-PINT increased radiosensitivity by interacting with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and negatively regulated the expression and recruitment of DNA-PKcs. Therefore, these findings collectively support the possibility that LINC-PINT serves as an attractive target to overcome radioresistance in NPC."

Metabolic reprogramming of immune cells is also seen in the tumor microenvironment. In the past decade, immunometabolism has progressively become an extraordinarily vibrant and productive area of study in immunology because of its importance for immunotherapy. Understanding the immunometabolic situation of T cells and other immune cells along with the metabolic behavior of cancer cells can help us design new therapeutic approaches against cancers.

In serous ovarian cancer (SOC), the endothelin A receptor (ETAR) drives invadopodia by a not fully explored coordinated function of beta-arrestin1 (beta-arr1). Here, we report that beta-arr1 links the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/beta PIX complex to activate Rac3 GTPase, acting as a central node in the adhesion-based extracellular matrix (ECM) sensing and degradation. Downstream, Rac3 phosphorylates PAK1 and cofilin and promotes invadopodium-dependent ECM proteolysis and invasion. Furthermore, ETAR/ILK/Rac3 signaling supports the communication between cancer and mesothelial cells, favoring SOC cell adhesion and transmigration. In vivo, ambrisentan, an ETAR antagonist, inhibits the adhesion and spreading of tumor cells to intraperitoneal organs, and invadopodium marker expression. As prognostic factors, high EDNRNILK expression correlates with poor SOC clinical outcome. These findings provide a framework for the ET-1R/beta-arr1 pathway as an integrator of ILK/Rac3-dependent adhesive and proteolytic signaling to invadopodia, favoring cancer/stroma interactions and metastatic behavior."

Recent studies have emphasized the tumor suppressive role of TSC1 in several human cancers including liver, lung, bladder, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. TSC1 perceives inputs from various signaling pathways, including TNF-alpha/IKK-beta, TGF-beta-Smad2/3, AKT/Foxo/Bim, Wnt/beta-catenin/Notch, and MTOR/Mdm2/p53 axis, thereby regulating cancer cell proliferation, metabolism, migration, invasion, and immune regulation.

The functions of circKIF4A were explored by CCK-8, transwell, and mouse xenograft experiments. Knockdown of circKIF4A could suppress papillary thyroid cell growth and migration. In addition, RIP assays and dual luciferase vector reporter assays were further conducted. Our consequence showed circKIF4A facilitated the malignant progress of papillary thyroid tumor by sponging miR-1231 and upregulating GPX4 expression. In conclusion, our study proved that circKIF4A-miR-1231-GPX4 axis played a vital role in cancer proliferation and ferroptosis by competing endogenous RNAs. Therefore, targeting circKIF4A is very likely to be a potential method for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer in the future."

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms and functional relevance remain elusive. We here show that USP39, a component of the spliceosome, is frequently overexpressed in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and that an elevated level of USP39 is associated with a poor prognosis. USP39 promotes proliferation/invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, USP39 was transcriptionally activated by the oncogene protein c-MYC in ovarian cancer cells. We further demonstrated that USP39 colocalizes with spliceosome components in nuclear speckles. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that USP39 deletion led to globally impaired splicing that is characterized by skipped exons and overrepresentation of introns and intergenic regions. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing showed that USP39 preferentially binds to exon-intron regions near 5 ' and 3 ' splicing sites. In particular, USP39 facilitates efficient splicing of HMGA2 and thereby increases the malignancy of ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that USP39 functions as an oncogenic splicing factor in ovarian cancer and represents a potential target for ovarian cancer therapy."

Therefore, our study was conducted to elucidate the DUXAP8 expression in LUAD and its mechanism on the biological features of LUAD cells. Loss-of-function experiments were performed to assess the function of DUXAP8 proliferation and apoptosis of H1975 and A549 cells. Functionally, silencing DUXAP8 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of LUAD cells. Mechanistically, further correlation assay indicated a negative association between miR-26b-5p and DUXAP8 expression. Subsequently, we testified that DUXAP8 exerted its role in the progression and development of LUAD through targeting miR-26b-5p. In summary, our results elucidated that that DUXAP8 promoted tumor progression in LUAD by targeting miR-26b-5p, which provide a novel therapeutic target for diagnosis and therapy of LUAD."

As the major component of tobacco and e-cigarettes, nicotine is not only responsible for addiction to smoking but also a carcinogen. Here we report that nicotine enhances ESCC cancer malignancy and tumor-initiating capacity by interacting with cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 7 subunit (CHRNA7) and subsequently activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. We found that aberrant CHRNA7 expression can serve as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In multiple ESCC mouse models, dextromethorphan and metformin synergistically repressed nicotine-enhanced cancer-initiating cells (CIC) properties and inhibited ESCC progression. Mechanistically, dextromethorphan non-competitively inhibited nicotine binding to CHRNA7 while metformin downregulated CHRNA7 expression by antagonizing nicotine-induced promoter DNA hypomethylation of CHRNA7. Since dextromethorphan and metformin are two safe FDA-approved drugs with minimal undesirable side-effects, the combination of these drugs has a high potential as either a preventive and/or a therapeutic strategy against nicotine-promoted ESCC and perhaps other nicotine-sensitive cancer types as well."

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is the dominant oncogenic pathway in PCa and the main strategy of PCa treatment is to control the AR activity. A large number of patients acquire resistance to Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) due to AR aberrant activation, resulting in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AR signaling in the PCa is critical to identify new therapeutic targets for PCa patients. The recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques identified an increasing number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that play critical roles through various mechanisms in different diseases. Some ncRNAs have shown great potentials as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Many ncRNAs have been investigated to regulate PCa through direct association with AR. In this review, we aim to comprehensively summarize recent findings of the functional roles and molecular mechanisms of AR-related ncRNAs as AR regulators or targets in the progression of PCa."

Besides its clinical value, little is known about its molecular function. Its similarity to SH3BP4, involved in regulating uptake and recycling of transmembrane receptors, suggests a role of MACC1 in endocytosis. By exploring the MACC1 interactome, we identified the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME)-associated proteins CLTC, DNM2 and AP-2 as MACC1 binding partners. We unveiled a MACC1-dependent routing of internalized transferrin receptor towards recycling. Elevated MACC1 expression caused also the activation and internalization of EGFR, a higher rate of receptor recycling, as well as earlier and stronger receptor activation and downstream signaling. These effects are limited by deletion of CME-related protein interaction sites in MACC1. Thus, MACC1 regulates CME and receptor recycling, causing increased growth factor-mediated downstream signaling and cell proliferation. This novel mechanism unveils potential therapeutic intervention points restricting MACC1-driven metastasis."

However, CD147 methylation and its subsequent role in cancer cell metabolism remain unclear. Here, we detect CD147 di-methylation in 16 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CD147 is di-methylated to CD147-K234me2 by lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A). The increase in KMT5A expression boosts the levels of CD147-K234me2, further promoting the interaction between CD147 and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), which enhances the translocation ofMCT4 from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Overexpression of CD147-K234me2 and KMT5A enhances glycolysis and lactate export in NSCLC cells. Clinical analysis shows that high CD147-K234me2 expression is significantly related to cancer progression and overall survival, and has prognostic significance in individuals with NSCLC, especially for those in the early stages.

Notably, co-activation of receptors synergistically triggered further decline in the cAMP level, promoted cell proliferation, and increased the expression of cancer progression-related genes, suggesting that physical and functional crosstalk between LPA(2) and GRR55 is involved in cancer progression."

Due to the complexity of TME, a single biomarker is insufficient to describe the complex biological characteristics of tumor and its microenvironment. Therefore, it is more meaningful to explore a group of effective biomarkers reflecting different characteristics of cancer to evaluate the biological characteristics of solid tumors. Here, the immune gene CD34/CD276 with different m6A peak was obtained by m6A sequencing (MeRIP-seq) of colon cancer (CRC)clinical samples and combined with MsIgDB database, which was used to perform cluster analysis on TCGA-COAD level 3 data. The CD34/CD276 as a molecular marker for CRC prognosis was confirmed by survival analysis and immunohistochemical assay. Further bioinformatics analysis was carried out to analyze the molecular mechanism of CD34/CD276 affecting the TME through m6a-dependent down-regulation and ultimately promoting immune escape of CRC."

Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is a critical metabolic process underpinning cellular proliferation supplying carbons for the synthesis of nucleotides incorporated into DNA and RNA. Recent research has focused on the nutrients that supply one-carbons to the folate cycle, particularly serine. Tryptophan is a theoretical source of one-carbon units through metabolism by IDO1, an enzyme intensively investigated in the context of tumor immune evasion. Using in vitro and in vivo pancreatic cancer models, we show that IDO1 expression is highly context dependent, influenced by attachment-independent growth and the canonical activator IFN gamma. In IDO1-expressing cancer cells, tryptophan is a bona fide one-carbon donor for purine nucleotide synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that cancer cells release tryptophan-derived formate, which can be used by pancreatic stellate cells to support purine nucleotide synthesis."

Therapeutic targeting of ATR yields durable regressions in small cell lung cancers with high replication stress	CANCER CELL			English	Article							DNA-DAMAGE; GENOMIC INSTABILITY; OPEN-LABEL; TOPOTECAN; TUMORS; TRANSCRIPTION; ACTIVATION; CHECKPOINT; INHIBITORS; MODEL	"Small cell neuroendocrine cancers (SCNCs) are recalcitrant cancers arising from diverse primary sites that lack effective treatments. Using chemical genetic screens, we identified inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR), the primary activator of the replication stress response, and topoisomerase I (TOP1), nuclear enzyme that suppresses genomic instability, as synergistically cytotoxic in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In a proof-of-concept study, we combined M6620 (berzosertib), first-in-class ATR inhibitor, and TOP1 inhibitor topotecan in patients with relapsed SCNCs. Objective response rate among patients with SCLC was 36% (9/25), achieving the primary efficacy endpoint. Durable tumor regressions were observed in patients with platinum-resistant SCNCs, typically fatal within weeks of recurrence. SCNCs with high neuroendocrine differentiation, characterized by enhanced replication stress, were more likely to respond. These findings highlight replication stress as a potentially transformative vulnerability of SCNCs, paving the way for rational patient selection in these cancers, now treated as a single disease."

Here, we show that microRNA-194 (miR-194) is a regulator of epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. In clinical prostate cancer samples, miR-194 expression and activity were elevated in NEPC and inversely correlated with AR signaling. miR-194 facilitated the emergence of neuroendocrine features in prostate cancer cells, a process mediated by its ability to directly target a suite of genes involved in cell plasticity. One such target was FOXA1, which encodes a transcription factor with a vital role in maintaining the prostate epithelial lineage. Importantly, a miR-194 inhibitor blocked epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation and inhibited the growth of cell lines and patient-derived organoids possessing neuroendocrine features. Overall, our study reveals a post-transcriptional mechanism regulating the plasticity of prostate cancer cells and provides a rationale for targeting miR-194 in NEPC."

Accordingly, attempts have been made to target them at the protein level with little success. However, studies using high-throughput sequencing technologies suggest that only about 2% of the genome translates into proteins, whereas about 75% of the genome is transcribed into noncoding RNAs. Among noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have received tremendous attention in recent years as a crucial player in the regulation of almost all cellular processes involved in tissue homeostasis as well as in the development of various malignancies, including intestinal cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs play an instrumental role in the regulation of intestinal stem cells, injury-induced regeneration, and initiation and progression of intestinal tumors. Here, we summarize the recently discovered lncRNAs during intestinal homeostasis, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. We further present lncRNAs as diagnostic and therapeutic markers in intestinal pathologies."

Cancer cell migration, apoptosis, cell viability and mitochondrial fragmentation were evaluated following celastrol treatment. In addition, the expression level of MMP-2, MMP-9 and caspase-3 was evaluated following celastrol treatment. HeLa cell viability was 94.1 +/- 7, 53.4 +/- 4 and 36.3 +/- 2% at 1-100 mu M of celastrol, respectively. Apoptotic cell numbers were increased, and inhibition of larger wounds in cancer cells was observed following celastrol treatment.

Here, we report that RBM39 functions as a master transcriptional regulator that interacts with the MLL1 complex to facilitate chromatin binding and H3K4 trimethylation in breast cancer cells. We identify RBM39 functional domains required for DNA and complex binding and show that the loss of RBM39 has widespread effects on H3K4me3 and gene expression, including key oncogenic pathways. RBM39's RNA recognition motif 3 (RRM3) functions as a dominant-negative domain; namely, it disrupts the complex and H3K4me trimethylation and expression of RBM/MLL1 target genes. RRM3-derived cell-penetrating peptides phenocopy the effects of the loss of RBM39 to decrease growth and survival of all major subtypes of breast cancer and yet are nontoxic to normal cells. These findings establish RBM39/MLL1 as a major contributor to the abnormal epigenetic landscape in breast cancer and lay the foundation for peptide-mediated cancer-specific therapy based on disruption of RBM39 epigenomic functions."

The combination of inclusion and exclusion of introns and exons in pre-mRNA can generate vast diversity in mature mRNA from a limited number of genes. Cancer cells acquire cancer-specific mechanisms through aberrant splicing regulation to acquire resistance to treatment and to promote malignancy. Splicing regulation involves many factors, such as proteins, non-coding RNAs, and DNA sequences at many steps. Thus, the dysregulation of splicing is caused by many factors, including mutations in RNA splicing factors, aberrant expression levels of RNA splicing factors, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins biogenesis, mutations in snRNA, or genomic sequences that are involved in the regulation of splicing, such as 5' and 3' splice sites, branch point site, splicing enhancer/silencer, and changes in the chromatin status that affect the splicing profile. This review focuses on the dysregulation of RNA splicing related to cancer and the associated therapeutic methods."

Its targeting by Ibrutinib, the first specific inhibitor, represented a turning point for the therapy of certain types of B-cell leukemias/lymphomas and several more BTK inhibitors are today in the clinic or advanced clinical trials. BTK expression was successively found to occur also outside of the hematopoietic compartment. In fact, we identified p65BTK, a novel 65 kDa isoform lacking an N-term stretch of 86 amino acids (compared to the 77 kDa protein expressed in B cells) as highly expressed in colon cancer patients. We demonstrated that p65BTK is a powerful oncogene acting downstream of the RAS/MAPK pathway and necessary for RAS-mediated transformation. Notably, the kinase domain is conserved and therefore inhibited by the available BTK-targeting drugs (Ibrutinib, Spebrutinib, etc.) which we used to demonstrate that p65BTK is an actionable target in drug-resistant colorectal carcinomas. We found p65BTK expressed also in >50% non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and demonstrated that it is an actionable target in KRAS-mutated/EGFR-wild type drug-resistant NSCLC models (for which no targeted therapy is available). We also reported a significant correlation between p65BTK expression and low-grade tumors and overall survival of patients with grade III gliomas and showed that its targeting induced a significant decrease in the viability of in glioma stem cells. Finally, in ovarian cancer patients, p65BTK expression levels correlate with early relapse and shorter progression-free survival, both indicators of resistance to therapy. Remarkably, Ibrutinib is more effective than standard of care (SOC) therapeutics in in vitro and ex vivo settings. On the whole, our preclinical data indicate that, depending on the tumor type, BTK inhibitors used alone can induce cytotoxicity (gliomas), be more effective than SOC chemotherapy (ovarian cancer) or can kill drug-resistant tumor cells when used in combination with SOC chemotherapy (colon cancer and NSCLC) or targeted therapy (NSCLC and ovarian cancer), thus suggesting that p65BTK may be an actionable target in different solid tumors. In addition, our data also give the proof-of-concept for starting clinical trials using BTK inhibitors, alone or in combination, to improve the therapeutic options for solid tumors treatment."

Nearly 191,930 new cases and 33,330 new deaths of PCa are estimated in 2020. Androgen and androgen receptor pathways played essential roles in the pathogenesis of PCa. Androgen depletion therapy is the most used therapies for primary PCa patients. However, due to the high relapse and mortality of PCa, developing novel noninvasive therapies have become the focus of research. Melatonin is an indole-like neurohormone mainly produced in the human pineal gland with a prominent anti-oxidant property. The anti-tumor ability of melatonin has been substantially confirmed and several related articles have also reported the inhibitory effect of melatonin on PCa, while reviews of this inhibitory effect of melatonin on PCa in recent 10 years are absent. Therefore, we systematically discuss the relationship between melatonin disruption and the risk of PCa, the mechanism of how melatonin inhibited PCa, and the synergistic benefits of melatonin and other drugs to summarize current understandings about the function of melatonin in suppressing human prostate cancer. We also raise several unsolved issues that need to be resolved to translate currently non-clinical trials of melatonin for clinic use. We hope this literature review could provide a solid theoretical basis for the future utilization of melatonin in preventing, diagnosing and treating human prostate cancer."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve as a type of well-recognized non-coding regulators and contribute to the modulation of liver cancer development, from the aspects of diagnosis, progression, and therapy. Here, we aimed to investigate the function of hsa_microRNA-513b-5p (miR-513b-5p) in regulating autophagy during HCC progression. Specifically, our data showed that miR-513b-5p mimic reduced the LC3-II and beclin1 expression but enhanced p62 expression in HCC cells. MiR-513b-5p repressed liver cancer cell proliferation, migration/invasion, and induced apoptosis in vitro. Crucially, miR-513b-5p attenuated tumor growth of liver cancer cells in vivo. In the mechanical investigation, we identified that PIK3R3 mRNA 3'UTR was targeted by miR-513b-5p and miR-513b-5p suppressed PIK3R3 expression. PIK3R3 overexpression partly reversed miR-513b-5p-mediated autophagy, proliferation, and apoptosis of liver cancer cells. Consequently, we concluded that miR-513b-5p repressed autophagy during the malignant progression of HCC by targeting PIK3R3. MiR-513b-5p may be applied as a therapeutic target for HCC."

GATA4 is a transcription factor that participates in the regulation and normal development of several endoderm- and mesoderm-derived tissues such as the pancreas. However, it remains unclear whether GATA4 is involved in the inflammation-driven development of pancreatic cancer. Here, we employed quantitative reverse transcription PCR, immunohistochemistry, and differential expression analysis to investigate the association between GATA4 and inflammation-driven PDAC. We found that overexpression of GATA4 in pancreatic tumor tissue was accompanied by increased levels of inflammatory macrophages. We used macrophage-conditioned medium to validate inflammation models following treatment with varying concentrations of lipopolysaccharide and determined whether GATA4-dependent inflammatory stimuli affected pancreatic cancer cell invasion and growth in vitro. Nude mouse models of dibutyltin dichloride-induced chronic pancreatitis with orthotopic tumor xenografts were used to evaluate the effect of the inflammatory microenvironment on GATA4 expression in vivo. Our findings indicate that overexpression of GATA4 dramatically aggravated inflammatory stimuli-induced pancreatic cancer cell invasion and growth via NF-kappa B and STAT3 signaling, whereas silencing of GATA4 attenuated invasion and growth. Overall, our findings suggest that inflammation-driven cancer progression is dependent on GATA4 expression and is mediated through the STAT3 and NF-kappa B signaling pathways."

High estrogen receptor alpha activation confers resistance to estrogen deprivation and is required for therapeutic response to estrogen in breast cancer	ONCOGENE			English	Article							POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; TAMOXIFEN; DIETHYLSTILBESTROL; ESR1; FULVESTRANT; ESTRADIOL; APOPTOSIS	"Estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive breast cancer is commonly treated with endocrine therapies, including antiestrogens that bind and inhibit ER activity, and aromatase inhibitors that suppress estrogen biosynthesis to inhibit estrogen-dependent ER activity. Paradoxically, treatment with estrogens such as 17b-estradiol can also be effective against ER+ breast cancer. Despite the known efficacy of estrogen therapy, the lack of a predictive biomarker of response and understanding of the mechanism of action have contributed to its limited clinical use. Herein, we demonstrate that ER overexpression confers resistance to estrogen deprivation through ER activation in human ER+ breast cancer cells and xenografts grown in mice. However, ER overexpression and the associated high levels of ER transcriptional activation converted 17b-estradiol from a growth-promoter to a growth-suppressor, offering a targetable therapeutic vulnerability and a potential means of identifying patients likely to benefit from estrogen therapy. Since ER+ breast cancer cells and tumors ultimately developed resistance to continuous estrogen deprivation or continuous 17b-estradiol treatment, we tested schedules of alternating treatments. Oscillation of ER activity through cycling of 17b-estradiol and estrogen deprivation provided long-term control of patient-derived xenografts, offering a novel endocrine-only strategy to manage ER+ breast cancer."

Its regulatory mechanism in breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the precise function of SPOCK1 in BC progression and to identify the mechanism by which SPOCK1 is involved in cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments and database analysis showed that high expression of SPOCK1 was positively associated with histological grade, lymph node metastasis (LN) and poor clinical prognosis in BC. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays elucidated that altering the SPOCK1 level led to distinct changes in BC cell proliferation and metastasis. Investigations of potential mechanisms revealed that SPOCK1 interacted with SIX1 to enhance cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and EMT by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway, whereas inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway or depletion of SIX1 reversed the effects of SPOCK1 overexpression. Furthermore, SPOCK1 and SIX1 were highly expressed in BC and might indicate poor prognoses. Altogether, the SPOCK1/SIX1 axis promoted BC progression by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway to accelerate cell proliferation and promote metastasis in BC, so the SPOCK1/SIX1 axis might be a promising clinical therapeutic target for preventing BC progression."

To migrate to distant sites, cancer cells would need to adapt their behaviour in response to different tissue environments. Thus, it is essential to study this process in models that can closely replicate the tumour microenvironment. Here, we evaluate the use of organotypic liver and brain slices to study cancer metastasis. Morphological and viability parameters of the slices were monitored daily over 3 days in culture to assess their stability as a realistic 3D tissue platform for in vitro metastatic assays. Using these slices, we evaluated the invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and of a subpopulation that was selected for increased motility. We show that the more aggressive invasion of the selected cells likely resulted not only from their lower stiffness, but also from their lower adhesion to the surrounding tissue. Different invasion patterns in the brain and liver slices were observed for both subpopulations. Cells migrated faster in the brain slices (with an amoeboid-like mode) compared to in the liver slices (where they migrated with mesenchymal or collective migration-like modes). Inhibition of the Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway increased cell stiffness and adhesion forces, which resulted in reduced invasiveness. These results illustrate the potential for organotypic tissue slices to more closely mimic in vivo conditions during cancer cell metastasis than most in vitro models."

E3 ligase-inactivation rewires CBL interactome to elicit oncogenesis by hijacking RTK-CBL-CIN85 axis	ONCOGENE			English	Article; Early Access								"Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that becomes activated upon Tyr371-phosphorylation and targets receptor protein tyrosine kinases for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Deregulation of CBL and its E3 activity is observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and other cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Here, we explore the oncogenic mechanism of E3-inactive CBL mutants identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms. We show that these mutants bind strongly to CIN85 under normal growth conditions and alter the CBL interactome. Lack of E3 activity deregulates CIN85 endosomal trafficking, leading to an altered transcriptome that amplifies signaling events to promote oncogenesis. Disruption of CBL mutant interactions with EGFR or CIN85 reduces oncogenic transformation. Given the importance of the CBL-CIN85 interaction in breast cancers, we examined the expression levels of CIN85, CBL, and the status of Tyr371-phosphorylated CBL (pCBL) in human breast cancer tissue microarrays. Interestingly, pCBL shows an inverse correlation with both CIN85 and CBL, suggesting that high expression of inactivated CBL could coordinate with CIN85 for breast cancer progression. Inhibition of the CBL-CIN85 interaction with a proline-rich peptide of CBL that binds CIN85 reduced the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, these results provide a rationale for exploring the potential of targeting the EGFR-CBL-CIN85 axis in CBL-inactivated mutant cancers."

Although cancer is fundamentally a non-communicable disease, a large number of cancers are known to have a viral aetiology. A high burden of infectious agents (Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV)) in certain Sub-Saharan African countries drives the rates of certain cancers. About one-third of all cancers in Africa are attributed to infection. Seven viruses have been identified with carcinogenic characteristics, namely the HPV, HBV, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Human T cell leukaemia virus 1 (HTLV-1), Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV), and HIV-1. The cellular splicing machinery is compromised upon infection, and the virus generates splicing variants that promote cell proliferation, suppress signalling pathways, inhibition of tumour suppressors, alter gene expression through epigenetic modification, and mechanisms to evade an immune response, promoting carcinogenesis. A number of these splice variants are specific to virally-induced cancers. Elucidating mechanisms underlying how the virus utilises these splice variants to maintain its latent and lytic phase will provide insights into novel targets for drug discovery. This review will focus on the splicing genomics, epigenetic modifications induced by and current therapeutic strategies against HPV, HBV, HCV, EBV, HTLV-1, KSHV and HIV-1."

To elucidate the manner in which p53 deals with glucose-deprived, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-prone conditions in this regard, two isogenic cancer subclones (HN3R-A and HN3R-B) bearing distinct p53 mutations as an in vitro model of intratumoral p53 heterogeneity were identified. Following cumulative irradiation, the subclones showed a similar metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis and increasing NADPH biogenesis for cellular defense against oxidative damage irrespective of p53 status. The radioresistant cancer cells became more sensitive to glycolysis-targeting drugs. However, in glucose-deprived and ROS-prone conditions, HN3R-B, the subclone with the original p53 increased the utilization of glutamine by GLS2, thereby maintaining redox homeostasis and ATP. Conversely, HN3R-A, the p53-deficient radioresistant subclone displayed an impairment in glutamine usage and high susceptibility to metabolic stresses as well as ROS-inducing agents despite the increased ROS scavenging system. Collectively, our findings suggest that p53 governs the alternative utilization of metabolic ingredients, such as glucose and glutamine, in ROS-prone conditions. Thus, p53 status may be an important biomarker for selecting cancer treatment strategies, including metabolic drugs and ROS-inducing agents, for recurrent cancers after radiotherapy."

The mechanisms underlying the regulation of BSP expression have been largely elusive. Given that BSP is involved in the homing of cancer cells in bone metastatic niches, we addressed regulatory effects of proteolytic cleavage and extracellular matrix components on BSP expression and distribution in cell culture models. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were kept in 2D and 3D spheroid cultures and exposed to basement membrane extract in the presence or absence of matrix metalloproteinase 9 or the non-polar protease, dispase. Confocal imaging of immunofluorescence samples stained with different antibodies against human BSP demonstrated a strong inducing effect of basement membrane extract on anti-BSP immunofluorescence. Similarly, protease incubation led to acute upregulation of anti-BSP immunofluorescence signals, which was blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting de novo formation of BSP. In summary, our data show that extracellular matrix components play an important function in regulating BSP expression and hint at mechanisms for the formation of bone-associated metastasis in breast cancer that might involve local control of BSP levels by extracellular matrix degradation and release of growth factors."

However, the process of mechanical characterization using AFM has been controversial and the influence of the membrane tension on AFM measurement results was often ignored. Here, a physical model involving a simultaneous consideration of the effects of the cell membrane, cytoskeleton network and cytosol was proposed. We carried out a theoretical analysis of AFM force relaxation curves, and as a result solved many of the remaining controversial issues regarding AFM-based mechanical characterization of cells, and provided a quantitative solution for the membrane tension measured using AFM indentation experiments for the first time. From the results of experiments on cells with different adherent shapes and different pairs of normal cells and cancer cells, we found additional force provided by membrane tension to be the main component of the force applied to the AFM probe, with decreased cell membrane tension being the essential reason for the greater softness of cancer cells than of normal cells. Hence, regulating membrane tension may become an important method for regulating the behavior of cancer cells."

They promote tumor growth, metastasis formation, and induce drug resistance. For these reasons, they are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. Here, with the aim of developing CAF-targeted drug delivery agents, we functionalized H-ferritin (HFn) nanocages with fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibody fragments. Functionalized nanocages (HFn-FAP) have significantly higher binding with FAP(+) CAFs than with FAP(-) cancer cells. We loaded HFn-FAP with navitoclax (Nav), an experimental Bcl-2 inhibitor pro-apoptotic drug, whose clinical development is limited by its strong hydrophobicity and toxicity. We showed that Nav is efficiently loaded into HFn (HNav), maintaining its mechanism of action. Incubating Nav-loaded functionalized nanocages (HNav-FAP) with FAP(+) cells, we found significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to non-functionalized HNav. This was correlated with a significantly higher drug release only in FAP(+) cells, confirming the specific targeting ability of functionalized HFn. Finally, we showed that HFn-FAP is able to reach the tumor and to target CAFs in a mouse syngeneic model of triple negative breast cancer after intravenous administration. Our data show that HNav-FAP could be a promising tool to enhance specific drug delivery into CAFs, thus opening new therapeutic possibilities focused on tumor microenvironment."

However, the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain to be investigated. In our present study, we found that the novel circRNA circHIF1A was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and that it was associated with metastasis, poor prognosis, and the TNBC subtype. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to investigate the biological roles of circHIF1A in TNBC. Overexpression of circHIF1A significantly promoted TNBC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of circHIF1A exerted the opposite effects. Mechanistically, circHIF1A modulated the expression and translocation of NFIB through posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications, resulting in the activation of the AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway and inhibition of P21. The RNA binding protein FUS could regulate the biogenesis of circHIF1A by interacting with the flanking intron, and FUS was transcriptionally regulated by NFIB, thus forming the circHIF1A/NFIB/FUS positive feedback loop. Moreover, circHIF1A could be packaged into exosomes and was upregulated in the plasma of breast cancer patients. Our findings indicated that circHIF1A played a critical role in the growth and metastasis of TNBC via a positive feedback loop and that circHIF1A could be a promising biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

While research had initially focused on signal transduction centered on beta-catenin as a key effector activating a pro-tumorigenic transcriptional response, nowadays it is known that WNT ligands can also induce a multitude of beta-catenin-independent cellular pathways. Traditionally, these comprise WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) and WNT/Ca2+ signaling. In addition, signaling via the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptors (RORs) has gained increasing attention in cancer research due to their overexpression in a multitude of tumor entities. Active WNT/ROR signaling has been linked to processes driving tumor development and progression, such as cell proliferation, survival, invasion, or therapy resistance. In adult tissue, the RORs are largely absent, which has spiked the interest in them for targeted cancer therapy. Promising results in preclinical and initial clinical studies are beginning to unravel the great potential of such treatment approaches. In this review, we summarize seminal findings on the structure and expression of the RORs in cancer, their downstream signaling, and its output in regard to tumor cell function. Furthermore, we present the current clinical anti-ROR treatment strategies and discuss the state-of-the-art, as well as the challenges of the different approaches."

Prevention of tumor cell proliferation and metastasis is vital for prolonging patient survival. Polyphenols provide a wide range of health benefits and prevention from cancer. In the gut, urolithins are the major metabolites of polyphenols. The objective of our study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of urolithin A (UA) on colorectal cancer cells. UA was found to inhibit the cell proliferation of CRC cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in HT29, SW480, and SW620 cells. Exposure to UA resulted in cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner along with alteration in the expression of cell cycle-related protein. Treatment of CRC cell lines with UA resulted in the induction of apoptosis. Treatment of HT29, SW480, and SW620 with UA resulted in increased expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, p53 and p21. Similarly, UA treatment inhibited the anti-apoptotic protein expression of Bcl-2. Moreover, exposure of UA induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Furthermore, UA was found to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CRC cells.

Although several consistent genomic changes were observed previously between SCCE and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), detailed mutational landscapes revealing discrepancies in genetic underpinnings of tumorigenesis between these two cancers are scarce, and little attention has been paid to answer whether these genetic alterations were related to the prognosis. Herein by performing whole-exome sequencing of 48 SCCE and 64 SCLC tumor samples, respectively we have shown that the number of driver mutations in SCCE was significantly lower than in SCLC (p = 0.0042). In SCCE, 46% of recurrent driver mutations were clonal, which occurred at an early stage during tumorigenesis, while 16 driver mutations were found clonal in SCLC. NOTCH1/3, PIK3CA, and ATM were specifically clonal in SCCE, while TP53 was clonal in SCLC. The total number of clonal mutations differed between two cancers and presented lower in SCCE compared to SCLC (p = 0.0036). Moreover, overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with higher numbers of clonal mutations for both cancers. In summary, SCCE showed distinct mutational background and clonal architecture compared with SCLC.

Methods: lncRNA M6A modification in colorectal cancer (CRC) was comprehensively analyzed for the first time. Results: M6A levels of InRNAs in CRC tissues were higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. A total of 8,332 M6A peaks were detected in 6,690 lncRNAs in CRC tissues. Approximately 91% of the modified lncRNAs had unique M6A modification peaks. A total of 383 lncRNAs were differentially methylated in CRC, of which 48.24% had a length of 1-1,000 bp. Most of these were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 11, 16 and 19; 42.3% were within a sense-overlapping exon. RNA sequencing identified 163 differentially expressed lncRNAs in CRC. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that genes near differentially-methylated or -expressed lncRNAs were associated with CRC occurrence and development. Methylation was positively correlated with lncRNA expression levels in CRC and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. More unmethylated than M6A methylated lncRNA molecules were detected. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and lncRNA-mRNA expression-regulation network revealed a regulatory relationship between lncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs. Conclusions: The findings may help improve our understanding of lncRNA function in colorectal cancer."

Patients with gastric cancer treated in Shijiazhuang First Hospital as well as healthy individuals undergoing physical examinations were recruited to measure the expression of exosomal miR-1228. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted and the patients were followed up. BM-MSCs from healthy subjects were collected and exosomes were extracted. The MSC cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors carrying miR-1228 and MMP-14 over-expression sequences and scramble sequence, followed by exosome extraction. The exosomes were co-cultured with SGC-7901 and MGC-823 cells to detect cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and migration.

P53 alteration is now recognized as a common event in the pathogenesis of many types of human malignancies. Deregulation of tumor suppressor p53 pathways plays an important role in the activation of cell proliferation or inactivation of apoptotic cell death during carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Mounting evidence indicates that the p53 status of tumors and also the regulatory functions of p53 may be relevant to the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA)-dependent gene regulation programs. Besides coding genes, lncRNAs that do not encode for proteins are induced or suppressed by p53 transcriptional response and thus control cancer progression. LncRNAs also have emerged as key regulators that impinge on the p53 signaling network orchestrating global gene-expression profile. Studies have suggested that aberrant expression of lncRNAs as a molecular-genomic signature may play important roles in cancer biology. Accordingly, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms by which the crosstalk between lncRNAs and p53 occurs in the development of numerous cancers. Here, we review how several classes of lncRNAs and p53 pathways are linked together in controlling the cell cycle and apoptosis in various cancer cells in both human and mouse model systems."

This well-established foundation of knowledge combined with the imaging and genetic capacities of the zebrafish provides a new frontier in cancer immunology research. In this review, we provide an overview of the development of the zebrafish immune system along with a side-by-side comparison of its human counterpart. We then introduce components of the adaptive immune system with a focus on their roles in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of teleosts. In addition, we summarize zebrafish models developed for the study of cancer and adaptive immunity along with other available tools and technology afforded by this experimental system. Finally, we discuss some recent research conducted using the zebrafish to investigate adaptive immune cell-tumor interactions. Without a doubt, the zebrafish will arise as one of the driving forces to help expand the knowledge of tumor immunity and facilitate the development of improved anti-cancer immunotherapy in the foreseeable future."

Sperm proteins and cancer-testis antigens are released by the seminiferous tubules in mice and men	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						biomarker; cancer&#8208; testis antigen; interstitial fluid; sperm; testis		"Sperm develop from puberty in the seminiferous tubules, inside the blood-testis barrier to prevent their recognition as non-self by the immune system, and it is widely assumed that human sperm-specific proteins cannot access the circulatory or immune systems. Sperm-specific proteins aberrantly expressed in cancer, known as cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), are often pursued as cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets based on the assumption they are neoantigens absent from the circulation in healthy men. Here, we identify a wide range of germ cell-derived and sperm-specific proteins, including multiple CTAs, that are selectively deposited by the Sertoli cells of the adult mouse and human seminiferous tubules into testicular interstitial fluid (TIF) that is outside the blood-testis barrier. From TIF, the proteins can access the circulatory- and immune systems. Disruption of spermatogenesis decreases the abundance of these proteins in mouse TIF, and a sperm-specific CTA is significantly decreased in TIF from infertile men, suggesting that exposure of certain CTAs to the immune system could depend on fertility status. The results provide a rationale for the development of blood-based tests useful in the management of male infertility and indicate CTA candidates for cancer immunotherapy and biomarker development that could show sex-specific and male-fertility-related responses."

Here, we systematically analyzed the RNA sequencing data of 13931 pseudogenes in 775 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, and ultimately identified 15 prognostic pseudogenes by univariate Cox proportional hazard regression. A risk score model was constructed based on the prognostic pseudogenes via LASSO analysis and dichotomized patients into low- and high-risk subgroups. Patients in the high-risk group had a significantly shorter overall survival than those in the low-risk group. The prognostic value of these 15 pseudogenes and the risk score model were further validated in the European Genome-Phenome Archive dataset. Furthermore, we performed consensus clustering of the 15 prognostic pseudogenes and found that their expression pattern was significantly associated with tumor malignancy and host antitumor immune response, in terms of infiltrating immune cell compositions, antigen presenting genes expression, cytolytic activity and T-cell exhausted markers. This study indicated that these 15 prognostic pseudogenes were significantly correlated with tumor malignancy and host antitumor immune response in breast cancer, and might serve as potential targets for immunotherapy."

Silencing PAPOLA in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reduced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth by decreasing steady-state cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA and protein levels. Whereas the length of the CCND1 mRNA poly(A) tail was not affected, its 3 ' untranslated region (3 ' UTR) lengthened. Overexpressing PAPOLA caused CCND1 mRNA 3 ' UTR shortening with a concomitant increase in the amount of corresponding transcript and protein, resulting in growth arrest in MCF-7 cells and DNA damage in HEK-293 cells. Such overexpression of PAPOLA promoted proliferation in the p53 mutant MDA-MB-231 cells.

Despite the recent progress in understanding the molecular events involved in PeCa, the lack of well-characterized in vitro models precludes new advances in anticancer drug development. Here we describe the establishment of five human primary penile cancer-derived cell cultures, including two epithelial and three cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cells. Using high-throughput genomic approaches, we found that the epithelial PeCa derived- cells recapitulate the molecular alterations of their primary tumors and present the same deregulated signaling pathways. The differentially expressed genes and proteins identified are components of key oncogenic pathways, including EGFR and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. We showed that epithelial PeCa derived cells presented a good response to cisplatin, a common therapeutic approach used in PeCa patients. The growth of a PeCa-derived cell overexpressing EGFR was inhibited by EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, gefitinib, and erlotinib). We also identified CAF signature markers in three PeCa-derived cells with fibroblast-like morphology, indicating that those cells are suitable models for PeCa microenvironment studies. We thus demonstrate the utility of PeCa cell models to dissect mechanisms that promote penile carcinogenesis, which are useful models to evaluate therapeutic approaches for the disease."

Overexpression of FOXP3 and CTLA4 is associated with immunosuppressive TME and poor prognosis in many cancer types. However, opposite results were reported in CRC. Thus, we performed comprehensive analyses to evaluate the exact prognostic value of FOXP3 and CTLA4 in CRC. Here, the expression levels of FOXP3 and CTLA4 were used to construct a subtyping system based on >1200 CRC patients from multiple independent public datasets. We revealed that, in CRC patients with relatively high expression of FOXP3, there exist two different subpopulations with opposite survival patterns according to CLTA4 expression. We further established a method for evaluating all cohorts and identified a novel FOXP3(High)CTLA4(High*) CRC risk subpopulation that accounts for 5-10% of CRC patients. Moreover, different methods of functional enrichment and immune evaluation were used to analyze the TME characteristics of different FOXP3/CTLA4 subtypes. The FOXP3(High)CTLA4(High*) CRC risk subpopulation was characterized by an immune overdrive TME phenotype, including high immune cell infiltration, low tumor purity, high immune checkpoint levels, and TGF-beta activation. Finally, the constructed FOXP3/CTLA4 subtyping system was further validated by quantitative RT-PCR, immunochemistry staining, and multicolor immunofluorescence in an independent CRC cohort we collected. This high-risk subpopulation was also observed in kidney cancers and low-grade glioma patients by a Pan-cancer analysis. Together, our study revealed that the established FOXP3/CTLA4 molecular subtyping system could be used to select treatment and management strategies for CRC and other cancers."

FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Review						cholesterol; cancer; lipid rafts; cell death; invasion; metastases; therapy	INSIGHTS	"Cholesterol is a lipid molecule that plays an essential role in a number of biological processes, both physiological and pathological. It is an essential structural constituent of cell membranes, and it is fundamental for biosynthesis, integrity, and functions of biological membranes, including membrane trafficking and signaling. Moreover, cholesterol is the major lipid component of lipid rafts, a sort of lipid-based structures that regulate the assembly and functioning of numerous cell signaling pathways, including those related to cancer, such as tumor cell growth, adhesion, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Considering the importance of cholesterol metabolism, its homeostasis is strictly regulated at every stage: import, synthesis, export, metabolism, and storage. The alterations of this homeostatic balance are known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis, but mounting evidence also connects these behaviors to increased cancer risks. Although there is conflicting evidence on the role of cholesterol in cancer development, most of the studies consistently suggest that a dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis could lead to cancer development. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of cholesterol homeostasis in normal and cancerous cells, summarizing key findings from recent preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated the role of major players in cholesterol regulation and the organization of lipid rafts, which could represent promising therapeutic targets."

The poor prognosis of BLCA patients is due to the lack of early diagnosis and disease recurrence after treatment.

In this study, we carried out a pan-cancer analysis of the NFAT family and found that NFAT2 is an independent prognostic factor for BLCA. We then screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and further analyzed such candidate gene loci using gene ontology enrichment to curate the KEGG database. We then used Lasso and multivariate Cox regression to identify 4 gene loci (FER1L4, RNF128, EPHB6, and FN1) which were screened together with NFAT2 to construct a prognostic model based on using Kaplan-Meier analysis to predict the overall survival of BLCA patients. Moreover, the accuracy of our proposed model is supported by deposited datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Finally, a nomogram of this prognosis model for BLCA was established which could help to provide better disease management and treatment."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is acknowledged as an aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In this study, we found the lncRNA LINC00472 was poorly expressed in TNBC tissues and cells. Overexpression of LINC00472 could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. On the contrary, minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) was highly expressed in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells due to suppressed methylation. LINC00472 induced site-specific DNA methylation and reduced the MCM6 expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferases into the MCM6 promoter. Since the restoration of MCM6 weakened the tumor suppressive effect of LINC00472 on MDA-MB-231 cells, LINC00472 potentially acted as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting MCM6. In addition, in vivo experiments further substantiated that overexpression of LINC00472 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis to lungs by decreasing the expression of MCM6. Overall, the present study demonstrated that LINC00472-mediated epigenetic silencing of MCM6 contributes to the prevention of tumorigenesis and metastasis in TNBC, providing an exquisite therapeutic target for TNBC."

Inhibition of CAMKK2 impairs autophagy and castration-resistant prostate cancer via suppression of AMPK-ULK1 signaling	ONCOGENE			English	Article								"Previous work has suggested androgen receptor (AR) signaling mediates prostate cancer progression in part through the modulation of autophagy. However, clinical trials testing autophagy inhibition using chloroquine derivatives in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have yet to yield promising results, potentially due to the side effects of this class of compounds. We hypothesized that identification of the upstream activators of autophagy in prostate cancer could highlight alternative, context-dependent targets for blocking this important cellular process during disease progression. Here, we used molecular, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to elucidate an AR-mediated autophagy cascade involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2; a kinase with a restricted expression profile), 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), but independent of canonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Increased CAMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling correlated with disease progression in genetic mouse models and patient tumor samples. Importantly, CAMKK2 disruption impaired tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple CRPC preclinical mouse models. Similarly, an inhibitor of AMPK-ULK1 blocked autophagy, cell growth, and colony formation in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our findings converge to demonstrate that AR can co-opt the CAMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling cascade to promote prostate cancer by increasing autophagy. Thus, this pathway may represent an alternative autophagic target in CRPC."

An intricate relationship between autophagy and the endosomal and exosomal pathways can occur at different stages with important implications for normal physiology and human diseases. Recent researches have revealed that extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, could have a cytoprotective role by inducing intracellular autophagy; on the other hand, autophagy plays a crucial role in the biogenesis and degradation of exosomes. Although the importance of these processes in cancer is well established, their interplay in tumor is only beginning to be documented. In some tumor contexts (1) autophagy and exosome-mediated release are coordinately activated, sharing the molecular machinery and regulatory mechanisms; (2) cancer cell-released exosomes impact on autophagy in recipient cells through mechanisms yet to be determined; (3) exosome-autophagy relationship could affect drug resistance and tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we survey emerging discoveries relevant to the exosomes and autophagy crosstalk in the context of cancer initiation, progression and recurrence. Consequently, we discuss clinical implications by targeting autophagy-exosomal pathway interaction and how this could lay a basis for the purpose of novel cancer therapeutics."

Our recent data have shown that 9-O-acetylated GD2 (9-OAcGD2) is the major O-acetylated ganglioside species in breast cancer cells. In 2015, Baumann et al. proposed that Cas 1 domain containing 1 (CASD1), which is the only known human sialyl-O-acetyltransferase, plays a role in GD3 O-acetylation. However, the mechanisms of ganglioside O-acetylation remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of CASD1 in GD2 O-acetylation in breast cancer. The role of CASD1 in OAcGD2 synthesis was first demonstrated using wild type CHO and CHO Delta Casd1 cells as cellular models. Overexpression using plasmid transfection and siRNA strategies was used to modulate CASD1 expression in SUM159PT breast cancer cell line. Our results showed that OAcGD2 expression was reduced in SUM159PT that was transiently depleted for CASD1 expression. Additionally, OAcGD2 expression was increased in SUM159PT cells transiently overexpressing CASD1. The modulation of CASD1 expression using transient transfection strategies provided interesting insights into the role of CASD1 in OAcGD2 and OAcGD3 biosynthesis, and it highlights the importance of further studies on O-acetylation mechanisms."

The current study presents a comparison of two senescent states of colon cancer cells, arrested and reversing, resulting from respectively, 120 h exposure to the drug, and 48 h exposure followed by 96 h regrowth in drug-free media. The upregulation of immunoproteasome subunit-coding genes and the increase in human leukocyte antigen HLA-A/B/C membrane level indicated MHC-I-restricted antigen presentation as common to both senescent states. Nuclear factor NF-kappa B p65 level decreased and activating protein AP-1: c-Jun, Fra2 and JunB nuclear levels increased in both senescent cell populations. Notably, the increase in AP-1-dependent transcription occurred after 48 h exposure to methotrexate. beta-catenin nuclear level increased after 48 h exposure to the drug and remained as such only in senescence-arrested cells. beta-catenin level was found uncoupled from the protein phosphorylation status indicating the deregulation of beta-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells employed in the study.

Concerted mutations in key tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, and oncogenes predispose cancer cells for marked utilization of resources to fuel accelerated cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Mounting research has demonstrated that PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) acts as a pivotal regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis in several cancer types, a function that also extends to the regulation of tumor cell proliferative capacity. In addition, involvement of PINK1 in modulating inflammatory responses has been highlighted by recent studies, further expounding PINK1's multifunctional nature. This review discusses the oncogenic roles of PINK1 in multiple tumor cell types, with an emphasis on maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, while also evaluating literature suggesting a dual oncolytic mechanism based on PINK1's modulation of the Warburg effect. From a clinical standpoint, its expression may also dictate the response to genotoxic stressors commonly used to treat multiple malignancies. By detailing the evidence suggesting that PINK1 possesses distinct prognostic value in the clinical setting and reviewing the duality of PINK1 function in a context-dependent manner, we present avenues for future studies of this dynamic protein."

However, the expression regulation, clinical significance, potential function, and mechanism of this gene in lung cancer remain unclear. Methylation status of MPDZ was measured by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the prognostic value of MPDZ. The tumor suppressing effects of MPDZ were determined in vitro and in vivo. The target molecules and signaling pathway that mediated the function of MPDZ were also identified. MPDZ methylation was identified in 61.2% of primary lung cancer tissues and most lung cancer cell lines but not in normal lung tissues. MPDZ expression was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues and negatively associated with DNA hypermethylation, and attenuated MPDZ expression predicted a poor outcome. Furthermore, MPDZ overexpression prominently dampened cell growth, migration, and invasion of tumor cells. Conversely, MPDZ knockdown promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MPDZ deficiency promotes tumor metastasis and reduces the survival of MPDZ knockout mice. Importantly, MPDZ promotes tumor suppressor ability that depends on the Hippo pathway-mediated repression of YAP. MPDZ activates the phosphorylation of YAP (Ser127) and inhibits YAP expression through stabilizing MST1 and interaction with LATS1. We first identified and validated that MPDZ methylation and expression could be a good diagnostic marker and independent prognostic factor for lung cancer. MPDZ functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through regulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway."

Even though several chemotherapy combinations are still the primary treatment of breast cancer, unsuccessful treatments, and poor prognostic outcomes are still being reported. DNA methylation and gene expression changes among two breast cancer cell lines representing luminal A (MCF-7) and triple-negative (MDA-MB-231) cancers were determined after sequential combination treatment of doxorubicin and paclitaxel and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Promoter methylation changes were seen in different treated MCF-7 cells and accompanied by changes in the gene expression of CCNA1 and PTGS2. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the hypomethylation of ESR1 was not accompanied by an increase in its gene expression in any treated cells. The hypomethylation of GSTP1 and MGMT was accompanied by an increase in gene expression levels in the group treated with doxorubicin only. Also, significant downregulation of several genes like MUC1 and MKI67 in MCF-7 cells treated with doxorubicin showed much lower gene expression (- 37.63, - 10.88 folds) when compared with cells treated with paclitaxel (- 2.47, - 2.05 folds) or the combination treatment (- 18.99, - 2.81 folds), respectively. On the other hand, a synergistic effect on MMP9 gene expression was significantly seen in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the combination (- 9.99 folds) in comparison with the cells treated with doxorubicin (- 3.62 folds) or paclitaxel (1.75 folds) alone.

Recently, increasing studies have indicated that exosomes can mediate cellular communication in assorted cancers, including BC. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have also been confirmed to take part in the regulation of many cancers. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1133 (LINC01133) is an lncRNA and its roles in several cancers have been revealed. However, the functions of exosomes and LINC01133 in BC are still not elucidated. In our research, functional assays were conducted to evaluate the function of LINC01133, as well as the influence of exosomes and LINC01133 on BC cells. Western blot assay, immunofluorescence assay, electron microscope, and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied for detecting the characteristics of exosomes. Bioinformatics tools and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed to test the expression of LINC01133 in BC cells and exosomes of the immortalized human uroepithelial cell line (SV-HUC-1). Luciferase reporter assay was performed to measure the activity of the Wnt pathway. We discovered that LINC01133 expression was high in exosomes of SV-HUC-1 and low in that of BC cells. Additionally, exosomes restrained cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Similarly, LINC01133 exerted the same function on BC cells. In addition, the Wnt signaling pathway could be inactivated by LINC01133. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that cell growth could be suppressed by overexpressed LINC01133. In short, exosomes-mediated transfer of lncRNA LINC01133 repressed BC progression via regulating the Wnt signaling pathway."

Dendritic cell (DCs) vaccines based on neoantigens have exciting effects in treatment of some malignant tumors and are a promising therapeutic modality. Lung cancer is a lethal disease with the highest morbidity and mortality rate in the world. Despite the rapid development of targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer in recent years, their efficacy is still unsatisfactory overall. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for lung cancer treatment. Here, we attempted to treat lung cancer using a personalized neoantigen peptide-pulsed autologous DC vaccine and conducted a single-arm, 2 medical centers, pilot study initiated by the investigator (ChiCTR-ONC-16009100, NCT02956551). The patients enrolled were patients with heavily treated metastatic lung cancer. Candidate neoantigens were derived from whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of fresh biopsy tissues as well as bioinformatics analysis. A total of 12 patients were enrolled in this study. A total of 85 vaccine treatments were administered with a median value of 5 doses/person (range: 3-14 doses/person). In total, 12-30 peptide-based neoantigens were selected for each patient. All treatment-related adverse events were grade 1-2 and there were no delays in dosing due to toxic effects.

Piperlongumine (PL), a major alkaloid in the fruit of Piper longum Linn. has gained worldwide attention for its anticancer properties, however, its mechanism of action in the chemoprevention of colon cancer has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the present study was designed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of PL in preventing DMH/DSS induced experimental colon cancer in mice. In the current study well established DMH/DSS induced experimental colon cancer mouse model was used to demonstrate the chemopreventive potential of PL. The expression of NF-kappa B and its downstream target proteins was evaluated mainly through western blotting. In addition, CAM assay, immunohistochemical staining and gelatin zymography was used to show anti-angiogenic and anti-invasive potential of PL. Additionally, important tumor biomarkers such as TSA, LASA, LDH and IL-6 levels were also estimated. The results of current study showed that PL was capable to inhibit NF-kappa B activation as well as its nuclear translocation. PL administration to DMH/DSS treated mice also inhibited the NF-kappa B downstream signaling cascades such as including COX-2 pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, beta-catenin, Notch signaling pathway, angiogenesis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway. The findings of the present study have claimed PL as promising chemopreventive agent for colon cancer with pleiotropic action. The current study emphasizes that regular consumption of PL can be an effective approach in the prevention of colon cancer in humans."

Here we deciphered the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation of MACC1, a causative driver for cancer metastasis, for cancer cell signaling and novel interventions to restrict cancer metastasis. We identified MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate. MEK1 directly phosphorylates MACC1, leading to accelerated and increased ERK1 activation. Mutating in silico predicted hierarchical MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites abrogates MACC1-induced migration, invasion, and MET expression, a transcriptional MACC1 target. Targeting MEK1 by RNAi or clinically applicable MEK1 inhibitors AZD6244 and GSK1120212 reduces MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation and restricts MACC1-induced metastasis formation in mice. Although MEK1 levels, contrary to MACC1, are not of prognostic relevance for CRC patients, MEK1 expression was found indispensable for MACC1-induced metastasis. This study identifies MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation decisively impacting cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis. Thus, MAP kinase signaling is not linear leading to ERK activation, but branches at the level of MEK1. This fundamental finding opens new therapeutic options for targeting the MEK1/MACC1 axis as novel vulnerability in patients at high risk for metastasis. This might be extended from CRC to further solid tumor entities."

Thus, there is a clinical need to improve early detection of CRC and personalize therapy for patients with this disease. In the era of precision oncology, liquid biopsy has emerged as a major approach to characterize the circulating tumor elements present in body fluids, including cell-free DNA and RNA, circulating tumor cells, and extracellular vesicles. This non-invasive tool has allowed the identification of relevant molecular alterations in CRC patients, including some indicating the disruption of epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic alterations found in solid and liquid biopsies have shown great utility as biomarkers for early detection, prognosis, monitoring, and evaluation of therapeutic response in CRC patients. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the most relevant epigenetic mechanisms associated with cancer development and progression, and the implications of their deregulation in cancer cells and liquid biopsy of CRC patients. In particular, we describe the methodologies used to analyze these epigenetic alterations in circulating tumor material, and we focus on the clinical utility of epigenetic marks in liquid biopsy as tumor biomarkers for CRC patients. We also discuss the great challenges and emerging opportunities of this field for the diagnosis and personalized management of CRC patients."

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related biomarkers can be used for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients. To explore, accurate prediction models are essential to the diagnosis and treatment for bladder cancer. In the present study, an EMT-related long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) model was developed to predict the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer. Firstly, the EMT-related lncRNAs were identified by Pearson correlation analysis, and a prognostic EMT-related lncRNA signature was constructed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Then, the diagnostic efficacy and the clinically predictive capacity of the signature were assessed. Finally, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and functional enrichment analysis were carried out with bioinformatics. An EMT-related lncRNA signature consisting of TTC28-AS1, L1NCO2446, AL662844.4, AC105942.1, AL049840.3, SNHG26, USP30-AS1, PSMB8-AS1, AL031775.1, AC073534.1, 062317.2, C5orf56, AJ271736.1, and ALA 39385.1 was constructed. The diagnostic efficacy of the signature was evaluated by the time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, in which all the values of the area under the ROC (AUC) were more than 0.73. A nomogram established by integrating clinical variables and the risk score confirmed that the signature had a good clinically predict capacity. GSEA analysis revealed that some cancer-related and EMT-related pathways were enriched in high-risk groups, while immune-related pathways were enriched in low-risk groups. Functional enrichment analysis showed that EMT was associated with abundant GO terms or signaling pathways. In short, our research showed that the 14 EMT-related lncRNA signature may predict the prognosis and progression of patients with bladder cancer."

From this perspective, detecting cancer gene expression and transcriptome changes is important for exploring tumor metastasis molecular mechanisms and cellular events. Precisely estimating a patient's cancer state and prognosis is the key challenge to develop a patient's therapeutic schedule. In the recent years, a variety of machine learning techniques widely contributed to analyzing real-world gene expression data and predicting tumor outcomes. In this area, data mining and machine learning techniques have widely contributed to gene expression data analysis by supplying computational models to support decision-making on real-world data. Nevertheless, limitation of real-world data extremely restricted model predictive performance, and the complexity of data makes it difficult to extract vital features. Besides these, the efficacy of standard machine learning pipelines is far from being satisfactory despite the fact that diverse feature selection strategy had been applied. To address these problems, we developed directed relation-graph convolutional network to provide an advanced feature extraction strategy. We first constructed gene regulation network and extracted gene expression features based on relational graph convolutional network method. The high-dimensional features of each sample were regarded as an image pixel, and convolutional neural network was implemented to predict the risk of metastasis for each patient. Ten cross-validations on 1,779 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas show that our model's performance (area under the curve, AUC = 0.837; area under precision recall curve, AUPRC = 0.717) outstands that of an existing network-based method (AUC = 0.707, AUPRC = 0.555)."

But there is a dearth of reports on the antiangiogenic effects of PARP inhibitors and the suppression of angiogenesis by this drug combination is not yet reported. For the successful development of cancer therapeutics, anti-cancer drugs ought to have anti-angiogenic potentiality along with their DNA damaging abilities. In this current piece of work, we investigated the in vitro and in ovo anti-angiogenic effect of Curcumin and Veliparib (a PARP inhibitor) in oral cancer. Recent evidences suggest an involvement of the NECTIN-4 in cancer angiogenesis and the exact molecular pathway of this involvement remains to be delineated. We observed that the soluble NECTIN-4 secreted from H357 oral cancer cells enhanced the angiogenesis of endothelial cells (HUVECs) and this was inhibited by Curcumin-Veliparib combination. NECTIN-4 enhanced vascularization, induced vasodilation and triggered the angiogenic sprouting via endothelial tip cell filopodia. Data indicated that NECTIN-4 mediated angiogenesis is associated with PI3K-AKT-mediated nitric oxide (NO) formation. A noticeable increase in the NO enhanced epithelial NO level through HIF-1 alpha mediated iNOS activation. We observed that increased NO enhanced the NECTIN-4 mediated eNOS expression and thereby elicited further angiogenesis. Curcumin antagonised the NECTIN-4-induced angiogenesis through inhibition of PI3K-AKT mediated eNOS pathway and Veliparib synergized the effect of Curcumin. Our observations indicate that NO is cardinal in inducing NECTIN-4 mediated angiogenesis in H357 cells. Thus, Curcumin-Veliparib combination suppresses angiogenesis through deregulation of the PI3K-AKT-eNOS pathway downstream to the NECTIN-4."

In this review, we focus on nine of the most studied terpenoids and on their cell death and autophagic activity. These terpenoids are grouped in three classes: sesquiterpenoid (artemisinin, parthenolide), diterpenoids (oridonin, triptolide), and triterpenoids (alisol, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, platycodin D, and ursolic acid). We have selected these nine terpenoids among others as they belong to the different major classes of terpenoids and our extensive search of the literature indicated that they were the most studied in terms of autophagy in cancer. These terpenoids alone demonstrate the complexity by which these secondary metabolites induce autophagy via complex signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK/JNK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, NF-kB, and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, induction of autophagy can be either destructive or protective in tumor cells. Nevertheless, should this phenomenon be well understood, we ought to be able to exploit it to create novel therapies and design more effective regimens in the management and treatment of cancer."

Meanwhile, CX43 was reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of metastatic breast cancer and melanoma brain colonization. In this study, we studied the role of long non-coding RNA CCRR and its interaction with CX43 in brain metastasis of breast cancer. Breast cancer patients were grouped according to the metastasis status. Real-time PCR and IHC assay were used to measure the expression of lncRNA-CCRR and CX43 in patients. Western blot was conducted to observe the effect of lncRNA-CCRR on the expression of CX43 in MDA-MB-231BR and BT-474BR cells. Compared with the non-metastasis group, the mRNA expression of tissue lncRNA-CCRR, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lncRNA-CCRR, tissue CX43 and tissue protein expression of CX43 were both evidently up-regulated in metastasis patients, especially in patients with brain metastasis. The expression of lncRNA-CCRR was positively correlated with the up-regulated expression of CX43. Moreover, CX43 expression was significantly lower in MDA-MB-231WT cells compared with that in MDA-MB-231BR cells. Also, the overexpression of lncRNA-CCRR evidently increased dye transfer rate from astrocytes to MDA-MB-231BR/BT-474BR cells but reduced lncRNA-CCRR expression and suppressed the transmigration of MDA-MB-231BR/BT-474BR cells in a blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of lncRNA-CCRR could up-regulate the expression of CX43, which promoted gap junction formation in brain metastasis of breast cancer. Accordingly, the communication between breast cancer cells and astrocytes was also promoted."

The mechanism of sitagliptin inhibition of colorectal cancer cell lines' metastatic functionalities	IUBMB LIFE			English	Article						aggregation; CD26; collagen; colorectal cancer; dipeptidyl peptidase 4; invasion; metastasis; motility; Sitagliptin		"The cell membrane glycoprotein CD26 with peptidase activity (DPP4) and/or its soluble CD26/DPP4 counterpart expression and/or activity are altered in several cancers. Its role in metastasis development was recently highlighted by the discovery of CD26(+) cancer stem cell subsets and the fact that clinical DPP4 inhibitors showed antimetastatic effects in animal models. Also, diabetic patients treated with the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin showed greater overall survival after colorectal or lung cancer surgery than patients under other diabetic therapies. However, the mechanism of action of these inhibitors in this context is unclear. We studied the role of CD26 and its DPP4 enzymatic activity in malignant cell features such as cell-to-cell homotypic aggregation, cancer cell motility, and invasion in a panel of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, avoiding models that include the physiological role of DPP4 in chemotaxis. Present results indicate that CD26 participates in the induction of cell invasion, motility, and aggregation of CD26-positive CRC cell lines. Moreover, only invasion and motility assays, which are collagen matrix-dependent, showed a decrease upon treatment with the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin. Sitagliptin showed opposite effects to those of transforming growth factor-beta 1 on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell cycle, but this result does not explain its CD26/DPP4-dependent effect. These results contribute to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind sitagliptin inhibition of metastatic traits. At the same time, this role of sitagliptin may help to define areas of medicine where DPP4 inhibitors might be introduced. However, they also suggest that additional tools against CD26 as a target might be used or developed for metastasis prevention in addition to gliptins."

Since enzalutamide is innovated and approved by US FDA as a new treatment option for mCRPC patients, drug resistance for enzalutamide is a critical issue during clinical usage. Although several underlying mechanisms causing enzalutamide resistance were previously identified, most of them revealed that drug resistant cells are still highly addicted to androgen and AR functions. Due to the numerous physical functions of AR in men, innovated AR-independent therapy might alleviate enzalutamide resistance and prevent production of adverse side effects. Here, we have identified that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant (EnzaR) cells. Furthermore, enzalutamide-induced YAP1 expression is mediated through the function of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII) at the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels. Functional analyses reveal that YAP1 positively regulates numerous genes related to cancer stemness and lipid metabolism and interacts with COUP-TFII to form a transcriptional complex. More importantly, YAP1 inhibitor attenuates the growth and cancer stemness of EnzaR cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, YAP1, COUP-TFII, and miR-21 are detected in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from EnzaR cells and sera of patients. In addition, treatment with EnzaR-EVs induces the abilities of cancer stemness, lipid metabolism and enzalutamide resistance in its parental cells. Taken together, these results suggest that YAP1 might be a crucial factor involved in the development of enzalutamide resistance and can be an alternative therapeutic target in prostate cancer."

Hence, the drugs that protect from metastasis either as an adjuvant or a primary therapeutic agent may help to reduce the death rate. In this study, All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) was tested for its action against metastatic lodging of B16F10 melanoma cells in the lung and liver of the C57BL/6 mouse model. Serum, lung and liver were evaluated biochemically for the cancer associated changes. Metastatic cancer development was confirmed by tumor nodule formation and histopathological analysis. RAR-beta protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histopathology. ATRA treated mice showed a percentage of inhibition on metastatic tumor growth in lung and liver and a corresponding protection against pathological changes in these organs. Cholesterol and gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) levels found in cancer induced mice were reduced in the ATRA treated group. As compared to the normal group, lung tissue from cell line induced cancer control group had less RAR-beta protein expression while the ATRA treated group showed enhanced RAR-beta protein expression. This indicates that the anti-metastasis effects of ATRA might have shown the induction of RAR-beta expression and subsequent molecular signaling pathways to regulate the homeostasis of biochemical changes. This study demonstrated the capability of ATRA to prevent the establishment of metastasis by the melanoma cell line into the lung and liver of experimental mice."	"[Grace, V. M.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the regulation of VGLL1 activation remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-mediated activation of VGLL1 and the VGLL1-TEAD4 interaction in gastric cancer cells. We showed that TGF beta enhanced VGLL1 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylated VGLL1 functioned as a transcription cofactor of TEAD4 in NUGC3 cells. TGF-beta also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) in NUGC3 cells, thereby triggering the translocation of phosphorylated RSK2 to the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RSK2 phosphorylated VGLL1 at S84 in the presence of TGF-beta. Mutation of VGLL1 at S84 suppressed VGLL1-TEAD4 binding and the subsequent transcriptional activation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Moreover, VGLL1 peptide containing S84 suppressed the TGF-beta-induced MMP9 expression and reduced the invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells, whereas VGLL1 peptide containing S84A did not. Furthermore, suppression of expression or activation of VGLL1 enhances the therapeutic effects of lapatinib. Collectively, these results indicate that VGLL1 phosphorylation via TGF-beta/ERK/RSK2 signaling plays a crucial role in MMP9-mediated malignancy of gastric cancer. In addition, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of the peptide containing VGLL1 S84 for the treatment of gastric cancer."

Therapeutic strategies that selectively target CSCs may be effective approaches to eliminate cancer. Salinomycin, an antitumor agent, was identified as a selective inhibitor of several types of CSCs. We previously reported that salinomycin inhibits the migration and invasiveness of Liver Cancer Stem Cells (LCSCs). Objective: This study was conducted to explore the role of salinomycin in suppressing the stemness properties of LCSCs and the mechanism. Methods: LCSCs were identified and enriched from MHCC97H cells. Salinomycin was used to treat LCSCs at the indicated concentrations. Sphere formation ability, chemotherapy resistance, expression of CSC surface markers, Young's modulus and tumorigenicity of LCSCs were assessed to evaluate the effect of salionmycin on LCSCs. The expression of beta-catenin was evaluated by western blotting. LiCl was used to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Results: Salinomycin suppresses the stemness properties of LCSCs. Moreover, salinomycin could also inhibit the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in LCSCs. Nevertheless, the stemness properties of LCSCs could be recovered when Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was activated by LiCl. Further studies demonstrated that salinomycin also significantly reduces the tumorigenicity of LCSCs in vivo by suppressing the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Conclusion: Salinomycin could suppress stemness properties and induce differentiation of LCSCs through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which provides evidence that salinomycin may serve as a potential drug for liver cancer therapy targeting LCSCs in the clinic."

Few studies describe the different lipid metabolisms and sensitivities to the microenvironment of breast cancer cell subtypes that influence the proliferation, aggressiveness, and success of therapy. This study describes the impact of lipid microenvironment on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and metabolic activity in two breast cancer cell lines with Luminal A and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) features. (2) Methods: We investigated the peculiar lipid phenotype of a TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231, and a Luminal A cell line, MCF7, and their different sensitivity to exogenous fatty acids (i.e., palmitic acid (PA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)). Moreover, we verified the impact of exogenous fatty acids on ER lipid composition. (3) Results: The data obtained demonstrate that MDA-MB-231 cells are more sensitive to the lipid microenvironment and that both PA and DHA are able to remodel their ER membranes with consequences on resident enzyme activity. On the contrary, MCF7 cells are less sensitive to PA, whereas they incorporate DHA, although less efficiently than MDA-MB-231 cells. (4) Conclusions: This study sustains the importance of lipid metabolism as an innovative hallmark to discriminate breast cancer subclasses and to develop personalized and innovative pharmacological strategies. The different sensitivities to the lipid environment shown by MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells might be related to cell malignancy and chemoresistance onset. In the future, this new approach could lead to a substantial decrease both in deleterious side effects for the patients and in the cost of entire therapeutic treatments coupled with increased therapy efficiency."

Tumor cells undergo senescence in response to several cancer therapeutics in vitro (Therapy-Induced Senescence, TIS), including agents utilized as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the treatment of invasive breast cancer. TIS has been proposed to contribute to adverse therapy outcomes including relapse. However, there is limited evidence on the induction of senescence in response to NAC in clinical cancer and its contribution to disease outcomes. In this work, the expression of three senescence-associated markers (p21(CIP1), H3K9Me3 (histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation), and Lamin B1) was investigated in breast cancer samples that developed partial or incomplete pathological response to NAC (n=37). Accordingly, 40.54% of all samples showed marker expression consistent with a senescence-like phenotype, while the remainders were either negative or inconclusive for senescence (2.70 and 56.8%, respectively). Moreover, analysis of core-needle biopsies revealed minimal changes in p21(CIP1) and H3K9Me3, but significant changes in Lamin B1 expression levels following NAC, highlighting amore predictive role of Lamin B1 in senescence detection. However, our analysis did not establish an association between TIS and cancer relapse as only three patients (8.1%) with a senescence-like profile developed short-term recurrent disease. Our analysis indicates that identification of TIS in tumor samples requires large-scale transcriptomic and proteinmarker analyses and extended clinical follow-up. Better understanding of in vivo senescence should elucidate its contribution to therapy outcomes and pave the way for the utilization of senolytic approaches as potential adjuvant cancer therapy."

Delineating the impact of tumor-intrinsic adaptive resistance mechanisms on immune-based therapies is essential to improve long-term efficacy. We discuss the different tumor-intrinsic factors that lead to resistance to ACT. We highlight the potential of repurposing molecular targeted therapies to modulate immune responses and override intratumor resistance to ACT. Finally, we discuss the potential of combining targeted therapy and ACT as a new paradigm to improve the clinical efficacy of cancer therapeutics."

In this study, we demonstrate that Twist upregulates expression of microRNA 22 (miR-22) which, in turn, downregulates estrogen receptor alpha (ER) expression in breast cancer. Initial analysis of miR-22 and Twist expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines showed a direct correlation between Twist and miR-22 levels with miR-22 being highly expressed in ER negative cell lines. Overexpressing Twist caused increased miR-22 levels while downregulating it led to decreased miR-22 expression. To characterize the upstream promoter region of miR-22, we utilized rapid amplification of cDNA ends and identified the transcription start site and the putative promoter region of miR-22. Mechanistically, we determined that Twist, in combination with HDAC1 and DNMT3B, transcriptionally upregulates miR-22 expression by binding to E-boxes in the proximal miR-22 promoter. We also established that miR-22 causes an increase in growth in 3D but not 2D cultures. Importantly, we observed a direct correlation between increased breast cancer grade and Twist and miR-22 expression. We also identified two potential miR-22 binding sites in the 3 '-UTR region of ER and confirmed by promoter assays that miR-22 regulates ER expression by binding to both target sites. These results reveal a novel pathway of ER suppression by Twist through miR-22 activation that could potentially promote the ER negative phenotype in breast cancers."

Prognosis prediction of patients followed by medication guidance by detecting CNV of lung cancer is emerging as a promising precise treatment in the future. In this paper, the differences in CNV and gene expression between cancer tissue and normal tissue of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma data set were firstly analyzed, and greater differences were observed. Furthermore, CNV-driven differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were screened out, and then, a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network related to the gene CNV was established, which involved 9 lncRNAs, seven microRNAs, and 178 downstream messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Pathway enrichment analyses sequentially performed revealed that the downstream mRNAs were mainly enriched in biological pathways related to cell division, DNA repair, and so on, indicating that these mRNAs mainly affected the replication and growth of tumor cells. Besides, the relationship between lncRNAs and drug effects was explored based on previous studies, and it was found that LINC00511 and LINC00942 in the CNV-associated ceRNA network could be used to determine tumor response to drug treatment. As examined, the drugs affected by these two lncRNAs mainly targeted metabolism, target of rapamycin signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, and cell cycle. In summary, the present research was devoted to analyzing CNV, lncRNA, mRNA, and microRNA of lung cancer, and nine lncRNAs that could affect the CNV-associated ceRNA network we constructed were identified, two of which are promising in determining tumor response to drug treatment."

GPS2 has recently been identified as a significantly mutated gene in breast cancer and other malignancies and proposed to work as a putative tumor suppressor. However, molecular mechanisms by which GPS2 prevents cancer development and/or progression are largely unknown. Here, we have profiled the phenotypic changes induced by GPS2 depletion in MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that GPS2-deleted MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited increased proliferative, migratory, and invasive properties in vitro, and conferred greater tumor burden in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Transcriptomic, proteomic and phospho-proteomic profiling of GPS2-deleted MBA-MB-231 revealed a network of altered signals that relate to cell growth and PI3K/AKT signaling. Overlay of GPS2-regulated gene expression with MDA-MB-231 cells modified to express constitutively active AKT showed significant overlap, suggesting that sustained AKT activation is associated with loss of GPS2. Accordingly, we demonstrate that the pro-oncogenic phenotypes associated with GPS2 deletion are rescued by pharmacological inhibition of AKT with MK2206. Collectively, these observations confirm a tumor suppressor role for GPS2 and reveal that loss of GPS2 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through uncontrolled activation of AKT signaling. Moreover, our study points to GPS2 as a potential biomarker for a subclass of breast cancers that would be responsive to PI3K-class inhibitor drugs."

In this study, a short peptide sequence corresponding to PD-L1 amino acids 172-187 (from the extracellular Ig-like C-type domain, and with high predicted antigenicity and hydrophilicity) was used to generate a monoclonal antibody (mAb). The resultant PD-L1 mAb, clone HC16, was examined for binding specificity and reactivity in cancer cell-lines, as assessed by immunocytochemical, immunoblotting, and coimmunoprecipitation. The potential diagnostic and clinical applicability of clone HC16 was further tested using malignant tissue arrays derived from various cancer types analyzed with an automated immunohistochemical (IHC) staining platform. Additionally, tumor samples from patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were analyzed by western blotting. Clone HC16 showed obvious staining activity in lung and breast cancer tissues. Interestingly, we observed that PD-L1 level was negatively associated with clinical stage in NSCLC. Strong PD-L1 expression tended to be found in patients diagnosed with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC).

It arises from a complex milieu of host and environmental factors, including genetic and epigenetic changes in colon epithelial cells that undergo mutation, selection, clonal expansion, and transformation. The gut microbiota has recently gained increasing recognition as an additional important factor contributing to CRC. Several gut bacteria are known to initiate CRC in animal models and have been associated with human CRC. In this Review, we discuss the factors that contribute to CRC and the role of the gut microbiota, focusing on a recently described mechanism for cancer initiation, the so-called microbiota-induced bystander effect (MIBE). In this cancer mechanism, microbiota-driven parainflammation is believed to act as a source of endogenous mutation, epigenetic change and induced pluripotency, leading to the cancerous transformation of colon epithelial cells. This theory links the gut microbiota to key risk factors and common histologic features of sporadic CRC. MIBE is analogous to the well-characterized radiation-induced bystander effect. Both phenomena drive DNA damage, chromosomal instability, stress response signaling, altered gene expression, epigenetic modification and cellular proliferation in bystander cells. Myeloid-derived cells are important effectors in both phenomena. A better understanding of the interactions between the gut microbiota and mucosal immune effector cells that generate bystander effects can potentially identify triggers for parainflammation, and gain new insights into CRC prevention."

However, the association of SALL4 with the survival of GC patients is not well-understood, and the role of SALL4 in cancer progression is still unknown. In the present study, a total of 1,815 GC patients who underwent radical resection at Peking Cancer Hospital were included consecutively from 2015 to 2018, confirming the prognostic value of SALL4 and validating by data from TCGA and GEO. The protein and mRNA expression levels of SALL4 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and qPCR, respectively. Besides, GSEA and WGCNA were applied to explore the SALL4-related cancer-promoting signaling pathways and gene modules. Our results showed that overexpression of SALL4 was observed in 16.7% of GC patients. SALL4 positivity was associated with male, older age, mixed-type histology, late stages, lymphatic metastasis, vascular invasion, non-cardia location, high AFP level, and no EBV infection background. SALL4 could be served as a marker for prognostic prediction in GC, and SALL4-positive GC was significantly associated with shortened survival. Further, the bioinformatic analysis indicated that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was activated in SALL4-high cases compared with SALL4-low cases. Expression of SALL4 was also positively correlated with the expression of multiple co-expressed genes, such as TRIB3, which plays an important role in activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Our findings indicate that SALL4 is associated with clinicopathological features related to cancer progression in GC and its function in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway."

Ligustrazine (LSZ), a natural compound, has been reported to exert anti-cancer activity, although themechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects are not clear. The present study investigated the impact of LSZ on cell proliferation and migration by regulating microRNA-211 (miR-211) expression using the human ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3 cell lines. OC cells were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM LSZ, and quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to measure miR-211 levels in SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells with different treatment. Moreover, to further confirm the roles of miR-211 in LSZ induced anti-tumor effects, miR-211 expression was inhibited by transfection of miR-211 inhibitors in SK-OV-3 cells. Cell proliferation of transfected cells was evaluated using the CCK-8 and colony formation assay. The scratch assay was employed to assess cell migration and transwell assay was performed for evaluating the cell invasion. Protein levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were determined by Western blotting. We found that LSZ inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion ability of SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner; moreover, LSZ could significantly increase the expression of miR-211 in both SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3, and knockdown of miR-211 in SK-OV-3 cells partially abrogated the anti-tumor behavior of LSZ by promoting the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of SK-OV-3 cells. Thus, we found that LSZ can inhibit the proliferation and migration of OC cells via regulating miR-211. Our study suggests that LSZ might be a potential and effective treatment for OC."

Many studies have suggested that reduced stiffness would facilitate passing through extracellular matrix when cancer cells instigate a metastatic process. Here we investigated the compressive properties of melanoma cancer cells with different metastatic potentials at the whole-cell level. Differences in their compressive properties were analyzed by examining actin filament structure and actin-related gene expression. Methods Compressive tests were carried out for two metastatic B16 melanoma variants (B16-F1 and B16-F10) to characterize global compressive properties of cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis and fluorescence microscopic imaging were performed to clarify contribution of actin filaments to the global compressive properties. Results RNA-seq analysis and fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed the undeveloped structure of actin filaments in B16-F10 cells. The Young's modulus of B16-F10 cells was significantly lower than that of B16-F1 cells. Disruption of the actin filaments in B16-F1 cells reduced the Young's modulus to the same level as that of B16-F10 cells, while the Young's modulus in B16-F10 cells remained the same regardless of the disruption. Conclusions In B16 melanoma cancer cell lines, cells with higher metastatic potential were more deformable at the whole-cell level with undeveloped actin filament structure, even when highly deformed. These results imply that invasive cancer cells may gain the ability to inhibit actin filament development."

Although abnormal Notch activation is related to various tumors, the importance of single receptors and their mechanism of activation in distinct breast cancer subtypes are still unclear. Previous studies by our group demonstrated that Notch3 may inhibit the emergence and progression of breast cancer. PTEN is a potent tumor suppressor, and its loss of function is sufficient to promote the occurrence and progression of tumors. Intriguingly, numerous studies have revealed that Notch1 is involved in the regulation of PTEN through its binding to CBF-1, a Notch transcription factor, and the PTEN promoter. In this study, we found that Notch3 and PTEN levels correlated with the luminal phenotype in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Notch3 transactivated PTEN by binding CSL-binding elements in the PTEN promoter and, at least in part, inhibiting the PTEN downstream AKT-mTOR pathway. Notably, Notch3 knockdown downregulated PTEN and promoted cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In contrast, overexpression of the Notch3 intracellular domain upregulated PTEN and inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, inhibition or overexpression of PTEN partially reversed the promotion or inhibition of cell proliferation induced by Notch3 alterations. In general, Notch3 expression positively correlated with elevated expression of PTEN, ER, lower Ki-67 index, and incidence of involved node status and predicted better recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that Notch3 inhibits breast cancer proliferation and suppresses tumorigenesis by transactivating PTEN expression."

Vimentin is expressed during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Molecular dynamics of Vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) play a key role in metastasis. This article is an effort to provide thorough understanding of the relationship between Vimentin and aPKCs . We demonstrate that diminution of aPKCs lead to attenuate prostate cellular metastasis through the downregulation of Vimentin expression. siRNA knocked-down SNAIL1 and PRRX1 reduce aPKC activity along with Vimentin. Results suggest that aPKCs target multiple activation sites (Ser33/39/56) on Vimentin and therefore is essential for VIF dynamics regulation during the metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Understanding the aPKC related molecular mechanisms may provide a novel therapeutic path for prostate carcinoma.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known as a major contributor to drug resistance and recurrence. Accordingly, therapies targeting ovarian CSCs are needed to overcome the limitations of present treatments. This study evaluated the effect of trimebutine maleate (TM) targeting ovarian CSCs, using A2780-SP cells acquired by a sphere culture of A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells. TM is indicated as a gastrointestinal motility modulator and is known to as a peripheral opioid receptor agonist and a blocker for various channels. The GI50 of TM was approximately 0.4 mu M in A2780-SP cells but over 100 mu M in A2780 cells, demonstrating CSCs specific growth inhibition. TM induced G0/G1 arrest and increased the AV(+)/PI+ dead cell population in the A2780-SP samples. Furthermore, TM treatment significantly reduced tumor growth in A2780-SP xenograft mice. Voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) and calcium-activated potassium channels (BKCa) were overexpressed on ovarian CSCs and targeted by TM; inhibition of both channels reduced A2780-SP cells viability. TM reduced stemness-related protein expression; this tendency was reproduced by the simultaneous inhibition of VGCC and BKCa compared to single channel inhibition. In addition, TM suppressed the Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog pathways which contribute to many CSCs characteristics. Specifically, further suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by simultaneous inhibition of BKCa and VGCC is necessary for the effective and selective action of TM. Taken together, TM is a potential therapeutic drug for preventing ovarian cancer recurrence and drug resistance."

We collected as many relevant articles and microarray datasets as possible to assess the prognostic value of FUT8 expression in malignant tumors. For this purpose, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Springer, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan Fang, and eventually identified 7 articles and 35 microarray datasets (involving 6124 patients and 10 tumor types) for inclusion in meta-analysis. In each tumor type, FUT8 expression showed significant (p<0.05) correlation with one or more clinicopathological parameters; these included patient gender, molecular subgroup, histological grade, TNM stage, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and recurrence status. In regard to survival prognosis, FUT8 expression level was associated with overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, gastric cancer, and glioma. FUT8 expression was also correlated with disease-free survival in NSCLC, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and with relapse-free survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. For most tumor types, survival prognosis of patients with high FUT8 expression was related primarily to clinical features such as gender, tumor stage, age, and pathological category. Our systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed the association of FUT8 with clinicopathological features and patient survival rates for numerous malignant tumor types. Verification of prognostic value of FUT8 in these tumor types will require a large-scale study using standardized methods of detection and analysis."

Cancer-related anemia is one of the main features of cancer cachexia and mostly results in a poor prognosis. The disadvantages of the current therapies are obvious, but few new treatments have been developed because the pathological mechanism remains unclear. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells to generate a cancer-related anemia model. The treated group received daily intraperitoneal injections of SB505124. Blood parameters were determined with a routine blood counting analyzer. Erythroid cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The microarchitecture changes of the femurs were determined by micro-computed tomography scans. Smad2/3 phosphorylation was analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The changes in the hematopoietic stem cell niche were revealed by qPCR analysis of both fibrosis-related genes and hematopoietic genes, fibroblastic colony-forming unit assays, and lineage differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. Results: The mouse model exhibited hematopoietic suppression, marked by a decrease of erythrocytes in the peripheral blood, as well as an increase of immature erythroblasts and reduced differentiation of multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow. The ratio of bone volume/total volume, trabecular number, and cortical wall thickness all appeared to decrease, and the increased osteoclast number has led to the release of latent TGF beta and TGF beta signaling over-activation. Excessive TGF beta deteriorated the hematopoietic stem cell niche, inducing fibrosis of the bone marrow as well as the transition of mesenchymal stromal cells. Treatment with SB505124, a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF beta signaling, significantly attenuated the symptoms of cancer-related anemia in this model, as evidenced by the increase of erythrocytes in the peripheral blood and the normalized proportion of erythroblast cell clusters.

DCBLD2 overexpression promotes tumor occurrence, development, and metastasis. However, DCBLD2 sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs and its mechanism on tumor development are unknown. Methods: DCBLD2 expression differences in cancer and normal tissues were obtained from GEO and TCGA databases. DCBLD2 influence on prognosis was also compared, and the database analysis results were verified via the analysis of clinical samples. GDSC database was used to analyze the effect of DCBLD2 expression difference on 5-FU drug sensitivity on tumor cells. CCK-8, clone formation, scratch, Transwell invasion and migration assays were used to assess DCBLD2 effects on the proliferation, metastasis, and 5-FU drug sensitivity on HCT116 and Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells. Angiogenesis and Matrigel plug assays were used to study the effect of DCBLD2 on angiogenesis. Q-RCR and Western Blot were used to analyze DCBLD2 impact on the EMT signaling pathway, and TAP-MS assay with Co-IP verification was used to identify the downstream target proteins binding to DCBLD2. Results: Both database and clinical sample validation results showed that the expression of DCBLD2 in colorectal cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues, leading to poor prognosis of patients. GDSC database analysis showed that DCBLD2 overexpression caused tumor cell resistance to 5-FU. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the inhibition of DCBLD2 reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, inhibited the angiogenesis of endothelial cells, and enhanced the drug sensitivity to 5-FU. The results of q-RCR and Western Blot experiments showed that the inhibition of DCBLD2 can suppress the EMT signal. The results of TAP-MS assay showed that the proteins bound to DCBLD2 were enriched to the Focal adhesion pathway. The results of Co-IP assay show that DCBLD2 can combine with ITGB1, the key factor of Focal adhesion pathway. Conclusion: DCBLD2 may affect the development of colorectal cancer by regulating cell proliferation and motility, and modulate 5-FU resistance. Down-regulation of DCBLD2 can inhibit EMT signal and angiogenesis. DCBLD2 can combine with ITGB1, the key signal factor of the Focal adhesion pathway."

Uncovering its governing factors and underlying mechanism are important for cancer therapy. Here, we report that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), previously known as a transcription repressor and lysine methyltransferase, can directly interact with fibrillarin (FBL) to exert its role in translational regulation. We demonstrate that EZH2 enhances rRNA 2 '-O methylation via its direct interaction with FBL. Mechanistically, EZH2 strengthens the FBL-NOP56 interaction and facilitates the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Strikingly, EZH2 deficiency impairs the translation process globally and reduces internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation in cancer cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of EZH2 in cancer-related translational regulation. Yi et al. report that EZH2 exerts a PRC2-independent function in nucleoli, where it bridges FBL and NOP56 to facilitate rRNA methylation and subsequent IRES-dependent translation."

Our previous study suggested that CRT was upregulated and acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of CRT in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remains unclear. The expression level of CRT was upregulated in GBC tissues in comparison with adjacent non-tumor tissues and chronic cholecystitis tissues. Moreover, CRT expression was found to be correlated with the tumor size. Knockdown of CRT inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle and resulted in decreased resistance to gemcitabine, which was mediated by the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Collectively, the present results suggested a potential role of CRT in GBC progression and provided novel insights into the mechanism underlying the CRT-mediated chemosensitivity in GBC cells."

The neutrophil-associated inflammatory microenvironment aids tumor cells in metastatic colonization in lungs. Here, we show that tumor-secreted protease cathepsin C (CTSC) promotes breast-to-lung metastasis by regulating recruitment of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). CTSC enzymatically activates neutrophil membrane-bound proteinase 3 (PR3) to facilitate interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) processing and nuclear factor kappa B activation, thus upregulating IL-6 and CCL3 for neutrophil recruitment. In addition, the CTSC-PR3-IL-1 beta axis induces neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and formation of NETs, which degrade thrombospondin-1 and support metastatic growth of cancer cells in the lungs. CTSC expression and secretion are associated with NET formation and lung metastasis in human breast tumors. Importantly, targeting CTSC with compound AZD7986 effectively suppresses lung metastasis of breast cancer in a mouse model. Overall, our findings reveal a mechanism of how tumor cells regulate neutrophils in metastatic niches and support CTSC-targeting approaches for cancer treatment."

HCMV presence parallels the succession of the observed cellular and molecular events potentially ensuing the transformation process. Correlation between PGCCs detection and HCMV presence in breast cancer tissue further validates our hypothesis in vivo. Our study indicates that some clinical HCMV strains conserve the potential to transform HMECs and fit with a blastomere-like model of oncogenesis, which may be relevant in the pathophysiology of breast cancer and other adenocarcinoma, especially of poor prognosis."

After sorting of CD133 positive cells, sphere formation, colony formation, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were detected to explore the involvement of DPP10-AS1 and miR-127-3p in the colon cancer stem cell (CCSC) properties through gain- and loss-of function approaches. Furthermore, tumor xenograft in nude mice was conducted to investigate the effect of DPP10-AS1 and miR-127-3p on tumor growth in vivo. Poorly expressed DPP10-AS1 and ADCY1, while highly expressed miR-127-3p were found in CCSCs. Low expression of DPP10-AS1 was correlated with TNM stage, lymphatic node metastasis, and tumor differentiation. Upregulation of DPP10-AS1 increased ADCY1 protein expression, decreased the protein expression of CCSC-related factors, inhibited sphere formation, colony formation, proliferation, invasion and migration, and accelerated apoptosis of HT-29 and SW480 cells by suppressing the expression of miR-127-3p. Further, the above in vitro findings were also confirmed by in vivo assays. Taken together, this study demonstrates that DPP10-AS1 inhibits CCSC proliferation by regulating miR-127-3p and ADCY1, providing fresh insight into a promising novel treatment strategy for colon cancer."

Among these changes is the alteration of the cell metabolic/catabolic machinery that creates the most permissive conditions for invasion, dissemination, and survival. The lysosomal system has emerged as a crucial player in this malignant transformation, making this system a potential therapeutic target in cancer. By virtue of their ubiquitous distribution in mammalian cells, their multifaced activities that control catabolic and anabolic processes, and their interplay with other organelles and the plasma membrane (PM), lysosomes function as platforms for inter- and intracellular communication. This is due to their capacity to adapt and sense nutrient availability, to spatially segregate specific functions depending on their position, to fuse with other compartments and with the PM, and to engage in membrane contact sites (MCS) with other organelles. Here we review the latest advances in our understanding of the role of the lysosomal system in cancer progression. We focus on how changes in lysosomal nutrient sensing, as well as lysosomal positioning, exocytosis, and fusion perturb the communication between tumor cells themselves and between tumor cells and their microenvironment. Finally, we describe the potential impact of MCS between lysosomes and other organelles in propelling cancer growth and spread."

However, the mechanisms regarding to hypoxia differentially regulating cancer metastasis and proliferation are largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that hypoxia induced the expression of LIN28A at mRNA level but segregated LIN28A mRNAs in the P-bodies and thus inhibits the production of LIN28A protein. This unexpected finding suggests that there may be non-coding role for LIN28A mRNA in the progression of colon cancer. We further showed that the non-coding LIN28A mRNA promotes the metastasis but not proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we revealed that methionyl aminopeptidase 2 (METAP2) is one of the up-regulated metastasis regulators upon over-expression of non-coding LIN28A identified by mass spectrum, and confirmed that it is non-coding LIN28A mRNA instead of LIN28A protein promotes the expression of METAP2. Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of DICER abolished the promotional effects of non-coding LIN28A on the metastasis and METAP2 expression. Conclusively, we showed that hypoxia induces the production of LIN28A mRNAs but segregated them into the P-bodies together with miRNAs targeting both LIN28A and METAP2, and then promotes the metastasis by positively regulating the expression of METAP2. This study uncovered a distinctive role of hypoxia in manipulating the metastasis and proliferation by differently regulating the expression of LIN28A at mRNA and protein level."

Because of their non-chromosomal inheritance, ecDNA drives high oncogene copy number and intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, endowing tumors with the ability to rapidly change their genomes, accelerating tumor evolution, and contributing to therapeutic resistance. Further, the circular topology of ecDNA leads to enhanced chromatin accessibility, altered gene regulation, and massive oncogene transcription, driving tumor growth and progression, and placing ecDNA at the interface of cancer genomics and epigenetics. Recent studies show that ecDNA is a common event in many of the most aggressive forms of cancer, potentially challenging our current precision oncology approaches. In this review, we discuss what is known about ecDNA and its biological and clinical impact, highlighting new research and suggesting the promise, and some of the challenges ahead for the field."

The 5-year overall survival for patients with HNC has stayed around 40-50% for decades, with mortality being attributable mainly to late diagnosis and recurrence. Recently, non-coding RNAs, including tRNA halves, YRNA fragments, microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been identified in the blood and saliva of patients diagnosed with HNC. These observations have recently fueled the study of their potential use in early detection, diagnosis, and risk assessment. The present review focuses on recent insights and the potential impact that circulating non-coding RNA evaluation may have on clinical decision-making in the management of HNC."

Studying leukemia stem cell properties and vulnerabilities with human iPSCs	STEM CELL RESEARCH			English	Article								"The reprogramming of cancer cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can capture entire cancer genomes, and thus create genetically faithful models of human cancers. By providing stringent genetically clonal conditions, iPSC modeling can also unveil non-genetic sources of cancer heterogeneity and provide a unique opportunity to study them separately from genetic sources, as we recently showed in an iPSC-based model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genetically clonal iPSCs, derived from a patient with AML, reproduce, upon hematopoietic differentiation, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity with all the hallmarks of a leukemia stem cell (LSC) hierarchy. Here we discuss the lessons that can be learned about the LSC state, its plasticity, stability and genetic and epigenetic determinants from iPSC modeling. We also discuss the practical and translational implications of exploiting AML-iPSCs to prospectively isolate large numbers of iLSCs for large-scale experiments, such as screens, and for discovery of new therapeutic targets specific to AML LSCs."

As the cytoskeleton and cilia are implicated in metastasis and tumor suppression, we examined roles for LUZP1 in the context of cancer. Here we show that LUZP1 exhibits frequent genomic aberrations in cancer, with a predominance of gene deletions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of Luzp1 in mouse fibroblasts promotes cell migration and invasion features, reduces cell viability, and increases cell apoptosis, centriole numbers, and nuclear size while altering the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of Luzp1 also induced changes to ACTR3 (Actin Related Protein 3, also known as ARP3) and phospho-cofilin ratios, suggesting regulatory roles in actin polymerization, beyond its role in filament bundling. Our results point to an unprecedented role for LUZP1 in the regulation of cancer features through the control of actin cytoskeleton."

However, there is no definite understanding of the requirement of ERK5 in tumor growth and metastasis due to very limited characterization of the pathway in disease models. In this study, we report that a high level of ERK5 is a predictive marker of metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistically, our in vitro data revealed that ERK5 was critical for maintaining the invasive capability of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells through focal adhesion protein kinase (FAK) activation. Specifically, we found that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 was controlled by a kinase-independent function of ERK5. Accordingly, silencing ERK5 in mammary tumor grafts impaired FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397 and suppressed TNBC cell metastasis to the lung without preventing tumor growth. Collectively, these results establish a functional relationship between ERK5 and FAK signaling in promoting malignancy. Thus, targeting the oncogenic ERK5-FAK axis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer exhibiting aggressive clinical behavior."

In T and B lymphocytes, transgelin-2 is constitutively expressed, but in antigen-presenting cells, it is significantly upregulated upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Transgelin-2 acts as a molecular staple to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton, and it competes with cofilin to bind filamentous (F)-actin. This action may enable immune synapse stabilization during T-cell interaction with cognate antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, transgelin-2 blocks Arp2/3 complex-nucleated actin branching, which is presumably related to small filopodia formation, enhanced phagocytic function, and antigen presentation. Overall, transgelin-2 is an essential part of the molecular armament required for host defense against neoplasms and infectious diseases. However, transgelin-2 acts as a double-edged sword, as its expression is also essential for a wide range of tumor development, including drug resistance and metastasis. Thus, targeting transgelin-2 can also have a therapeutic advantage for cancer treatment; selectively suppressing transgelin-2 expression may prevent multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. Here, we review newly discovered molecular characteristics of transgelin-2 and discuss clinical applications for cancer and immunotherapy."

Recently, Otubains have emerged as essential regulators of diverse physiological processes, such as immune signaling and DNA damage response. Dysregulation of those processes is likely to increase the risk in multiple aspects of aging-related diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, chronic kidney diseases, bone dysplasia and pulmonary fibrosis. Consistently, Otubains are aberrantly expressed in cancers and have been identified to be both tumor suppressors and tumor promoters in different types of cancers. Therefore, the regulatory mechanism of the activity and expression of Otubains is very important for better understanding of Otubains-associated biological networks and human diseases. This review provides a comprehensive description of functions and regulatory axis of Otubains, highlighting experimental evidences indicating Otubains as potential therapeutic targets against aging-related disorders."

Condensates are membraneless bodies, often formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, that compartmentalize protein and RNA molecules with related functions. New insights from condensate studies portend a profound transformation in our understanding of cellular dysregulation in cancer. Here we summarize key features of biomolecular condensates, note where they have been implicated-or will likely be implicated-in oncogenesis, describe evidence that the pharmacodynamics of cancer therapeutics can be greatly influenced by condensates, and discuss some of the questions that must be addressed to further advance our understanding and treatment of cancer."

Our study aimed to explore the potential oncogenic role and the detailed molecular mechanism of HOXC6 in RCC. In this study, HOXC6 was validated to be overexpressed in RCC and associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, overexpression of HOXC6 promoted the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells through inducing EMT by activating the Wnt/beta -catenin signaling pathway and inhibition of DKK1 secretion. Lastly, we preliminary explored the translational effect of HOXC6 and found that silencing of HOXC6 made HCT116 and HT29 cells more sensitive to irinotecan."

This study aimed to research novel functions of B7-H3 in cellular senescence induced by a low dose of doxorubicin (DOX) in colorectal cancer (CRC).

B7-H3 knockdown dramatically enhanced the growth arrest of CRC cells after low-dose DOX treatment, but B7-H3 overexpression had the opposite effect. By RNA-seq analysis and western blot, we showed that B7-H3 prevented cellular senescence and growth arrest through the AKT/TM4SF1/SIRT1 pathway. Blocking the AKT/TM4SF1/SIRT1 pathway dramatically reversed B7-H3-induced resistance to cellular senescence. More importantly, B7-H3 inhibited DOX-induced cellular senescence of CRC cells in vivo.

Therefore, reestablishing p53 activity has become one of the most appealing anticancer therapeutic strategies. Here, we disclose the p53-activating anticancer drug (3S)-6,7-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-methyl-3-phenyl-1H,3H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]thiazole (MANIO). MANIO demonstrates a notable selectivity to the p53 pathway, activating wild-type (WT)p53 and restoring WT-like function to mutant (mut)p53 in human cancer cells. MANIO directly binds to the WT/mutp53 DNA-binding domain, enhancing the protein thermal stability, DNA-binding ability, and transcriptional activity. The high efficacy of MANIO as an anticancer agent toward cancers harboring WT/mutp53 is further demonstrated in patient-derived cells and xenograft mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC), with no signs of undesirable side effects. MANIO synergizes with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, and in vitro and in vivo studies predict its adequate drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties for a clinical candidate. As a single agent or in combination, MANIO will advance anticancer-targeted therapy, particularly benefiting CRC patients harboring distinct p53 status."

Due to lack of gene expression signatures for risk and prognosis stratification of CRC, identifying novel molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets may potentially improve CRC prognosis and treatment. RNF180 has been shown to play key contributions to the development of several types of cancers. In the current study, we investigate its role in CRC. In this study, we show that RNF180 expression was significantly downregulated in human CRC tumors and cell lines. Overexpression of RNF180 in CRC cells markedly inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis, while depletion of RNF180 dramatically enhanced cell survival. Moreover, WISP1 was found to be the critical downstream molecule that mediated the tumor suppressive effects of RNF180. Mechanistically, RNF180 ubiquitinated WISP1, resulting in WISP1 downregulation and ultimately leading to suppression of CRC tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Last, 5-FU and RNF180 had synergetic effect on the apoptosis induction and tumor growth inhibition. Our findings revealed a crucial role of RNF180 in suppressing tumor growth by ubiquitinating WISP1 in CRC."

Significant increments in XIST and exo-XIST from tumour tissues and blood serum were found in reoccurring TNBC patients by comparison with non-recurrences. Levels of serum exo-XIST were only significantly increased in TNBC recurrence and no association with other clinicopathological parameters. Additionally, serum exo-XIST levels could be served as an assessment of change in the load of triple-negative breast cancer. Expressions of exo-XIST were markedly decreased after resection of the primary breast tumours and obviously elevated at the time of recurrence. Finally, an obvious association was identified between serum exo-XIST levels and a poorer overall survival (OS) in TNBC patients.

Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs), a group of rate-limiting enzymes in fatty acid metabolism, catalyze the bioconversion of exogenous or de novo synthesized fatty acids to their corresponding fatty acyl-CoAs. In this study, systematical analysis of ACSLs levels and the amount of fatty acyl-CoAs illustrated that ACSL1 were significantly associated with the levels of a broad spectrum of fatty acyl-CoAs, and were elevated in human prostate tumors. ACSL1 increased the biosynthesis of fatty acyl-CoAs including C16:0-, C18:0-, C18:1-, and C18:2-CoA, triglycerides and lipid accumulation in cancer cells. Mechanistically, ACSL1 modulated mitochondrial respiration, beta-oxidation, and ATP production through regulation of CPT1 activity. Knockdown of ACSL1 inhibited the cell cycle, and suppressed the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and growth of prostate xenograft tumors in vivo. Our study implicates ACSL1 as playing an important role in prostate tumor progression, and provides a therapeutic strategy of targeting fatty acid metabolism for the treatment of prostate cancer."

CSCs have attracted remarkable research interest due to their role in tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment as well as recurrence. Extensive research has been devoted to the role of CSCs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, which is characterized by a dismal prognosis because of its aggressive course and poor response to treatment. The aim of the current paper is to provide an overview of current knowledge on the role of cancer stem cells in the pathogenesis and treatment resistance of glioblastoma. The six regulatory mechanisms of glioma stem cells (GSCs)-tumor microenvironment, niche concept, metabolism, immunity, genetics, and epigenetics-are reviewed. The molecular markers used to identify GSCs are described. The role of GSCs in the treatment resistance of glioblastoma is reviewed, along with future treatment options targeting GSCs. Stem cells of glioblastoma thus represent both a driving mechanism of major treatment difficulties and a possible target for more effective future approaches."

The oncogenic role of TINCR was examined in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer. Next, the interaction between TINCR, DNMT1, and miR-503-5p methylation was explored. Moreover, the mechanism by which TINCR enhances EGFR expression and downstream signaling via an RNA-RNA interaction was comprehensively investigated. Furthermore, upstream transcriptional regulation of TINCR expression by STAT3 was examined by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, feedback signaling in the STAT3-TINCR-EGFR downstream cascade was also investigated. TINCR is upregulated in human breast cancer tissues, and TINCR knockdown suppresses tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TINCR recruits DNMT1 to the miR-503-5p locus promoter, which increases the methylation and suppresses the transcriptional expression of miR-503-5p. Furthermore, TINCR also functions as a competing endogenous RNA to upregulate EGFR expression by sponging miR-503-5p. In addition, TINCR stimulates JAK2-STAT3 signaling downstream from EGFR, and STAT3 reciprocally enhances the transcriptional expression of TINCR. Our findings broaden the current understanding of the diverse manners in which TINCR functions in cancer biology. The newly identified STAT3-TINCR-EGFR-feedback loop could serve as a potential therapeutic target for human cancer."

However, the mechanisms that trigger polyploidy in cancer cells are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the origin of polyploidy in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a highly heterogenous cancer, using a combination of genomics and cell biology approaches in EAC cell lines, organoids, and tumors. We found the EAC cells and organoids present specific mitotic defects consistent with problems in the attachment of chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Time-lapse analyses confirmed that EAC cells have problems in congressing and aligning their chromosomes, which can ultimately culminate in mitotic slippage and polyploidy. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and quantitative immunofluorescence analyses revealed alterations in the copy number, expression, and cellular distribution of several proteins known to be involved in the mechanics and regulation of chromosome dynamics during mitosis. Together, these results provide evidence that an imbalance in the amount of proteins implicated in the attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules is the molecular mechanism underlying mitotic slippage in EAC.

While microsatellite instability (MSI) index has earlier been correlated with survival outcome in gastric cancer patients, the present study aims to construct a risk-stratification model based on immune-related genes in GC patients with varying MSI status. Results: The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified SEMA7A, NUDT6, SCGB3A1, NPR3, PTH1R, and SHC4 as signature genes, which were used to build the prognostic model for GC patients with microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L) and microsatellite stable (MSS). Whereas, for GC patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), prognostic model was established with three genes (SEMA6A, LTBP1, and BACH2), based on the univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Conclusion: The prognostic immune-related gene signature identified in this study may offer new targets for personalized treatment and immunotherapy for GC patients with MSI-H or MSI-L/MSS status. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ImmPort databases were used to extract expression data and to explore prognostic genes from the immune-related genes (IRGs), respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were applied to identify IRGs correlated with patient prognosis.

Neovascularization is closely related to the malignancy of tumors. We constructed a signature of angiogenesis-related long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. The lncRNA expression matrix of 424 HCC patients was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). First, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to distinguish the differentially expressed genes of the angiogenesis genes in liver cancer and adjacent tissues. Next, a signature of angiogenesis-related lncRNAs was constructed using univariate and multivariate analyses, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the accuracy. The signature and relevant clinical information were used to construct the nomogram. A 5-lncRNA signature was highly correlated with overall survival (OS) in HCC patients and performed well in evaluations using the C-index, areas under the curve, and calibration curves. In summary, the 5-lncRNA model can serve as an accurate signature to predict the prognosis of patients with liver cancer, but its mechanism of action must be further elucidated by experiments."

It is also not known if lncRNAs contribute to this metabolic adaption of cancer cells. Here we show that linc01564 is induced in response to glucose deprivation by the transcription factor ATF4. Linc01564 functions to facilitate hepatocellular carcinoma cell survival under glucose deprivation by activating the serine synthesis pathway. Mechanistically, linc01564 acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-107/103a-3p and attenuates the inhibitory effect of miR-107/103a-3p on PHGDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway, thereafter leading to increased PHGDH expression. Furthermore, linc01564 is able to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis via PHGDH. Together, these findings suggest that linc01564 is an important player in the regulation of metabolic adaption of cancer cells and also implicate linc01564 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer."

Notch signaling is frequently dysregulated in cancer. However, the role of Notch2 in TSCC is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of abnormal expression of Notch2 in TSCC. The expression of Notch2 was tested in 47 pairs of tissues from tongue cancer and normal samples by using immunohistochemical staining. Tongue cancer cells were transfected with siRNA or plasmid. The proliferation of the cells was tested by the CCK8 assay and colony formation assay. Subcutaneous tumor model was established to observe tumor growth. Transwell assay was used to detect the changes of cell migration and invasion ability. A humanized anti-Notch2 antibody was used to TSCC cells. We found that Notch2 was upregulated in tongue carcinoma tissues. Knocking down the expression of Notch2 by siRNA in the TSCC cell lines decreased proliferation ability both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, migration and invasion abilities were inhibited by knockdown of Notch2 in the TSCC cells. However, overexpression of Notch2 increased tongue cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. The humanized anti-Notch2 antibody inhibited TSCC cell growth. The results indicated that Notch2 is an oncogene in tongue squamous cell carcinoma and may become the target of a new approach for treating TSCC."

Inhibitors of the PD-1-PD-L1 axis have been approved as therapy for many human cancers. In spite of the evidence for their widespread clinical activity, little is known about the immunological alterations that occur in human cancer tissue after PD-1 blockade. We developed and employed a patient-derived tumor fragment platform to dissect the early immunological response of human tumor tissue to ex vivo PD-1 blockade. We observed that the capacity of immune cells to be reactivated ex vivo was predictive of clinical response, and perturbation analyses identified tumor-resident T cells as a key component of this immunological response. In addition, through combined analysis of baseline properties and immune response capacity, we identified a new subgroup of infiltrated tumors that lacks the capacity to respond to PD-1 blockade. Finally, the baseline presence of tertiary lymphoid structures and their components correlated with the capacity of cancers to undergo intratumoral immune cell reactivation."

Moreover, knockdown of FAM64A significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of PCa cells in vitro. Mechanistically, FAM64A expression was increased by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) through direct binding of AR to FAM64A promoter, and notably promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of androgen-dependent cell line of PCa. In addition, abnormal expression of FAM64A affects the immune and interferon signaling pathway of PCa cells. In conclusion, FAM64A was up-regulated by AR through directly binding to its specific promoter region to promote the development of PCa, and was associated with the immune mechanism and interferon signaling pathway, which provided a better understanding and a new potential for treating PCa."

Patients with cancer are currently prioritized in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination programs globally, which includes administration of mRNA vaccines. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has not been reported with mRNA vaccines and is an extremely rare immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We present a case of CRS that occurred 5 d after vaccination with BTN162b2 (tozinameran)-the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-in a patient with colorectal cancer on long-standing anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The CRS was evidenced by raised inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia, elevated cytokine levels (IFN-gamma/IL-2R/IL-18/IL-16/IL-10) and steroid responsiveness. The close temporal association of vaccination and diagnosis of CRS in this case suggests that CRS was a vaccine-related adverse event; with anti-PD1 blockade as a potential contributor. Overall, further prospective pharmacovigillence data are needed in patients with cancer, but the benefit-risk profile remains strongly in favor of COVID-19 vaccination in this population."

In this study, we introduced the most prevalent methods for processing bisulfite sequencing data and evaluated the consistency of the data acquired from different measurements in liver cancer. Firstly, we introduced three commonly used bisulfite sequencing assays, i.e., reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), and targeted bisulfite sequencing (targeted BS). Next, we discussed the principles and compared different methods for alignment, quality assessment, methylation level scoring, and differentially methylated region identification. After that, we screened differential methylated genes in liver cancer through the three bisulfite sequencing assays and evaluated the consistency of their results. Ultimately, we compared bisulfite sequencing to 450 k beadchip and assessed the statistical similarity and functional association of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) among the four assays. Our results demonstrated that the DMGs measured by WGBS, RRBS, targeted BS and 450 k beadchip are consistently hypo-methylated in liver cancer with high functional similarity."

This review summarizes the existing research on polyamine metabolism and function, specifically the role of polyamines in gastric immune cell and epithelial cell function. Polyamines have been implicated in a multitude of cancers, but in this review, we focus on the role of polyamine dysregulation in the context of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis and subsequent progression to gastric cancer.

Complicated factors are found to be conducive to accurate assessment of prognosis. In this study, we developed a series of prognostic prediction models for survival time of colon cancer patients after surgery. Analysis of nine clinical characteristics showed that the most important factor was the positive lymph node ratio (LNR). High LNR was the most important clinical factor affecting 1- and 3-year survival; M0&age < 70 was the most important feature for 5 years. The performance of the model was improved through the integration of clinical characteristics and four types of molecule features (mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation). The model provides guidance for clinical practice. According to the high-risk molecular features combined with age >= 70&T3, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, M0&well differentiated, M0&T2, LNR high, T4&poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated, the survival time may be less than 1 year; for patients with high risk of molecular features combined with M0&T2, M0&T4, LNR 0& M0, LNR median &T3, and LNR high, the survival is predicted less than 3 years; and the survival of patients with M1&T3, M0 and high risk molecular features is less than 5 years.

Therapy resistance can be both intrinsic and/or acquired. These are multifactorial events, and some are related to factors including adaptations in cancer stem cells (CSCs), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), deregulation of key signaling pathways, drug efflux through ABC transporters, acquired mutations, evading apoptosis, and activation of DNA damage response among others. Among these factors, CSCs represent the major source of therapy resistance. CSCs are a subset of tumor cells that are capable of self-renewal and multilineage progenitor expansion that are known to be intrinsically resistant to anticancer treatments. Multiple clones of CSCs pre-exist, and some can adopt and expand easily to changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and/or in response to radio- and chemotherapy. A combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributes to CSC-mediated therapy resistance. In this review, we will focus on CSCs and therapy resistance as well as suggest strategies to eliminate CSCs and, therefore, overcome resistance."

Altogether 14 ferroptosis-relevant genes with potential prognostic values were identified, based on which a risk score formula was constructed. According to the risk scores, we classified the patients into a high- and a low-risk score group. It was verified in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium) datasets. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with lower risk scores had significantly favorable overall survival (OS) (P < 0.0001).

Among the morphological features of oral cancer, the tumour-associated tissue eosinophilia has gained growing interest in the last years. Eosinophils are a minor subpopulation of leukocytes, representing 1-3% of all circulating white blood cells. The presence of high levels of eosinophils is associated with several diseases, but their role in cancer pathophysiology is controversial. In particular, an uncertain and contradictory relationship exists between the exact role of tumour-associated tissue eosinophilia and oral cancer development. Many studies have shown that tumour-associated tissue eosinophilia increases both in the progression of oral potentially malignant disorders as well as in the grade and stage progression of oral cancer. Despite this, both negative and positive prognostic outcomes have been associated with eosinophil infiltration. The heterogeneous results may be partially due both to several methodological inconsistencies and to an incorrect interpretation of the physiological role of eosinophils. Therefore, further studies to elucidate the contribution of eosinophil infiltration are needed, focusing on the existence of eosinophil subpopulations regulated by the cancer immune microenvironment.

Conclusion: This novel prognostic signature can effectively divide MIBC patients into different risk groups, allowing for intensive treatment of high-risk individuals who have worse predicted survival outcomes. Methods: Bioinformatics analyses were conducted using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differentially expressed genes and survival-associated immune-related genes (IRGs) were analyzed through a computational algorithm and Cox regression. The potential mechanisms of IRG expression were explored with transcription factors, and a prognosis classification based on IRG expression was developed to stratify patients into distinct risk groups."

The DEAD-box helicase DDX56 is a conserved stemness regulator in normal and cancer stem cells	CELL REPORTS			English	Article								"Across the animal kingdom, adult tissue homeostasis is regulated by adult stem cell activity, which is commonly dysregulated in human cancers. However, identifying key regulators of stem cells in the milieu of thousands of genes dysregulated in a given cancer is challenging. Here, using a comparative genomics approach between planarian adult stem cells and patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), we identify and demonstrate the role of DEAD-box helicase DDX56 in regulating aspects of stemness in four stem cell systems: planarians, mouse neural stem cells, human GSCs, and a fly model of glioblastoma. In a human GSC line, DDX56 localizes to the nucleolus, and using planarians, when DDX56 is lost, stem cells dysregulate expression of ribosomal RNAs and lose nucleolar integrity prior to stem cell death. Together, a comparative genomic approach can be used to uncover conserved stemness regulators that are functional in both normal and cancer stem cells."

Although the reactivation of embryonic signals in adult cells is one of the characteristics of cancer, the underlying protein degradation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the molecular chaperone GRP75 is a key player in PC cells by maintaining the protein stability of SIX1, a transcription factor for embryonic development. Mechanistically, GRP75 provides a platform to recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 to inhibit K48-linked polyubiquitination of SIX1. Structurally, the C-terminus of GRP75 (433-679 aa) contains a peptide binding domain, which is required for the formation of GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex. Functionally, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex suppresses tumor growth and overcomes the castration resistance of PC cells in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Clinically, the protein expression of SIX1 in PC tumor tissues is positively correlated with the expression of GRP75 and USP1. These new findings not only enhance our understanding of the protein degradation mechanism, but also may provide a potential way to enhance the anti-cancer activity of androgen suppression therapy."

This proline-rich, nuclear protein is highly conserved among placental mammals with prominent expression observed in pluripotent, germ, and cancer cells. In pluripotent and germ cells, its role has been implicated primarily in proper cell differentiation, whereas in cancer, it shows tissue-specific function, either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, UTF1 is crucial for germ cell development, spermatogenesis, and maintaining male fertility in mice. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of UTF1 in the generation of high quality induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and as an excellent biomarker to identify bona fide iPSCs. Functionally, UTF1 aids in establishing a favorable chromatin state in embryonic stem cells, reducing transcriptional noise and possibly functions similarly in re-establishing this state in differentiated cells upon their reprogramming to generate mature iPSCs. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of UTF1 and its implication in development, spermatogenesis, stem, and cancer cells."

We hypothesized that TNFAIP8 promotes prostate cancer (PCa) progression via regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. Ectopic expression of TNFAIP8 increased PCa cell proliferation/migration/spheroid formation by enhancing cell metabolic activities. Mechanistically, TNFAIP8 activated the PI3K-AKT pathway and up-regulated PCa cell survival. TNFAIP8 was also found to regulate the expression of glucose metabolizing enzymes, enhancing glucose consumption, and endogenous ATP production. Treatment with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), reduced TNFAIP8 mediated glucose consumption, ATP production, spheroid formation, and PCa cell migration. By maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, TNFAIP8 increased OXPHOS and glycolysis. Moreover, TNFAIP8 modulates the production of glycolytic metabolites in PCa cells. Collectively, our data suggest that TNFAIP8 exerts its oncogenic effects by enhancing glucose metabolism and by facilitating metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells. Therefore, TNFAIP8 may be a biomarker associated with prostate cancer and indicate a potential therapeutic target."

Maclurin is known for its dual-sided effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant tumor of the bone and is one of the most aggressive cancers. It is common especially in children and young adults and can progress into highly metastatic cancer. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of maclurin on U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. The results indicated that maclurin exerts prooxidative effects and induces apoptosis via capase-3-independent PARP regulation in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. Maclurin also inhibits the migration of U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. Maclurin modulates two of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinases that are closely linked with cancer metastasis; that is, it activates p38 and inactivates Extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The apoptosis-inducing effects of maclurin on U2OS osteosarcoma cells were diminished by additional treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), but the migration-inhibiting effect was not affected by NAC treatment. This further suggested the only apoptosis-inducing effect of maclurin may be strongly related to its prooxidative activity.

Nerves in the tumor microenvironment have been associated with poor survival and recurrence, particularly if involved in perineural invasion. However, usually only a few nerves inside a tumor are affected by perineural invasion, while most nerves are not. Mechanistic studies have shown nerve-secreted factors promote tumor growth and invasion thereby making tumors more aggressive. Therefore, the overall number of nerves in the tumor microenvironment should be more representative of the nerve-tumor biological interaction than perineural invasion. This review summarizes the available clinical information about nerve density as a measure of clinical outcome in cancer and explores the mechanisms underlying nerve density in cancer, specifically, neurogenesis, axonogenesis, and neurotropism."

Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the multistep process of breast cancer bone metastasis and tumor-induced osteolysis is of paramount interest. The serine/threonine kinase AKT plays a crucial role in breast cancer bone metastasis but the effect of individual AKT isoforms remains unclear. Therefore, AKT isoform-specific knockdowns were generated on the bone-seeking MDA-MB-231 BO subline and the effect on proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemotaxis was analyzed by live-cell imaging. Kinome profiling and Western blot analysis of the TGF beta/CTGF axis were conducted and metastasis was evaluated by intracardiac inoculation of tumor cells into NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. MDA-MB-231 BO cells exhibited an elevated AKT3 kinase activity in vitro and responded to combined treatment with AKT- and mTOR-inhibitors. Knockdown of AKT3 significantly increased migration, invasion, and chemotaxis in vitro and metastasis to bone but did not significantly enhance osteolysis. Furthermore, knockdown of AKT3 increased the activity and phosphorylation of pro-metastatic HER2 and DDR1/2 but lowered protein levels of CTGF after TGF beta-stimulation, an axis involved in tumor-induced osteolysis. We demonstrated that AKT3 plays a crucial role in bone-seeking breast cancer cells by promoting metastatic potential without facilitating tumor-induced osteolysis."

During RT therapy, cells can gradually acquire resistance implying adaptive radioresistance. Here we probe the mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance by first establishing radioresistant lines using ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 BC cells through repeated exposure to sub-lethal fractionated dose of 2Gy up to 15 fractions. Radioresistance was found to be associated with increased cancer stem cells (CSCs), and elevated EpCAM expression in the cell population. A retrospective analysis of TCGA dataset indicated positive correlation of high EpCAM expression with poor response to RT. Intriguingly, elevated EpCAM expression in the radioresistant CSCs raise the bigger question of how this biomarker expression contributes during radiation treatment in BC. Thereafter, we establish EpCAM overexpressing ZR-75-1 cells (ZR-75-1(EpCAM)), which conferred radioresistance, increased stemness through enhanced AKT activation and induced a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced contractility and invasiveness. In line with these observations, orthotopic implantation of ZR-75-1(EpCAM) cells exhibited faster growth, lesser sensitivity to radiation therapy and increased lung metastasis than baseline ZR-75-1 cells in mice. In summary, this study shows that similar to radioresistant BC cells, EpCAM overexpressing cells show high degree of plasticity and heterogeneity which ultimately induces radioresistant and metastatic behavior of cancer cells, thus aggravating the disease condition."

Robust breast cancer detection in mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis using an annotation-efficient deep learning approach	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION; PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS; SYSTEM	"Breast cancer remains a global challenge, causing over 600,000 deaths in 2018 (ref. (1)). To achieve earlier cancer detection, health organizations worldwide recommend screening mammography, which is estimated to decrease breast cancer mortality by 20-40% (refs. (2,3)). Despite the clear value of screening mammography, significant false positive and false negative rates along with non-uniformities in expert reader availability leave opportunities for improving quality and access(4,5). To address these limitations, there has been much recent interest in applying deep learning to mammography(6-18), and these efforts have highlighted two key difficulties: obtaining large amounts of annotated training data and ensuring generalization across populations, acquisition equipment and modalities. Here we present an annotation-efficient deep learning approach that (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance in mammogram classification, (2) successfully extends to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT; '3D mammography'), (3) detects cancers in clinically negative prior mammograms of patients with cancer, (4) generalizes well to a population with low screening rates and (5) outperforms five out of five full-time breast-imaging specialists with an average increase in sensitivity of 14%. By creating new 'maximum suspicion projection' (MSP) images from DBT data, our progressively trained, multiple-instance learning approach effectively trains on DBT exams using only breast-level labels while maintaining localization-based interpretability. Altogether, our results demonstrate promise towards software that can improve the accuracy of and access to screening mammography worldwide."

In our study, we tried to explain the role of p53 in kidney cancer through the p53-related enhancer RNA pathway. Functional experiments were used to explore whether P53-bound enhancer regions 2 (p53BER2) has a role in the cell cycle and senescence response of TP53-wild type (WT) renal cancer cells in vitro or vivo. RNA-sequencing was used to identify the potential target of p53BER2. The results showed that the expression level of P53BER2 was downregulated in renal cancer tissues and cell lines, further dual-luciferase experiments and APR-256-reactivated experiments showed p53BER2 expresses in a p53-dependent way. Moreover, knockdown p53BER2 could reverse nutlin-3-induced cytotoxic effect in TP53-WT cell lines. Further exploration showed the downregulation of p53BER2 could reverse nutlin-3-induced G1-arrest and senescence in TP53-WT cell lines. What is more, the knockdown of p53BER2 showed resistance to nutlin-3 treatment in vivo. Additionally, we found BRCA2 could be regulated by p53BER2 in vitro and vivo; further experiment showed p53BER2 could induce cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair by mediating BRCA2. In summary, the p53-associated enhancer RNA-p53BER2 mediates the cell cycle and senescence of p53 in TP53-WT renal cancer cells."

This process is controlled by a set of defined pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are upregulated in malignancies. MDSC have strong immunosuppressive potential and constitute a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor cells take advantage of the suppressive mechanisms of MDSC to establish an immunosuppressive TME which inhibits antitumor immune responses thereby promoting cancer progression. An immunosuppressive TME acts as a significant barrier to immunotherapeutic interventions. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that enrichment and activation of MDSC is correlated with tumor progression, recurrence and metastasis. In this review we discuss the potential impact of MDSC on tumor progression and its role as a biomarker of prognostic significance in cancer with a special focus on hepatocellular cancer (HCC)."

Among cell adhesion molecules, the claudin (CLDN) family is often aberrantly expressed in various cancers, but the biological relevance and molecular basis for this observation have not yet been established. Here, we show that high CLDN6 expression accelerates cellular proliferation and migration in two distinct human endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro. Using a xenograft model, we also revealed that aberrant CLDN6 expression promotes tumor growth and invasion in endometrial cancer tissues. The second extracellular domain and Y196/200 of CLDN6 were required to recruit and activate Src-family kinases (SFK) and to stimulate malignant phenotypes. Knockout and overexpression of ESR1 in endome trial carcinoma cells showed that the CLDN6-adhesion signal links to estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) to advance tumor progression. In particular, aberrant CLDN6-ER alpha signaling contributed to collective cell behaviors in the leading front of endometrial cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that CLDN6/SFK/PI3K-dependent AKT and SGK (serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase) signaling in endometrial cancer cells targets Ser518 in the human ER alpha to activate ER alpha transcriptional activity in a ligand-independent manner, thereby promoting tumor progression. Furthermore, CLDN6, at least in part, also regulated gene expression in an ER alpha-independent manner."

Given their similarity to normal stem cells, i.e. self-renewal and pluripotency the need arises to develop robust protocols for the isolation and characterization of CSCs. As with other malignancies, hepatic tumors are composed of a heterogeneous population of cells including liver cancer stem cells (LCSC). Yet, a precise understanding of why stem cells become cancerous is still lacking. There is unmet need to develop robust protocols for the successful isolation of LCSCs from human tissue resection material as to assist in the development of molecular targeted therapies. Here we review the research progress made in the isolation and characterization of LCSCs by considering a wide range of cell surface markers and sorting methods, as applied to side populations, microsphere cultures and the gradient centrifugation method. We emphasize the different fluorescence activated cell sorting methods and the possibility to enrich LCSCs by immunomagnetic beads. We review the specificity of functional assays by considering ABCG transporter and ALDH1 enzyme activities and evaluate the in vivo tumorigenicity of LCSCs in highly sensitive bioassays. Finally, we evaluate different LCSC markers in association with viral and non-viral liver disease and explore the potential of novel drug delivery systems targeting CD133, EpCAM, CD13 and CD90 for the development of molecular targeted therapies."

Upregulation of fatty acid uptake from the environment of cancer cells has also been reported as an alternative mechanism. To investigate the role of lipids in tumor onset and progression and to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers, lipids are ideally imaged directly within the intact tumor tissue in a label-free way. In this study, we investigated lipid accumulation and distribution in living zebrafish larvae developing a tumor by means of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy. Quantitative textural features based on radiomics revealed higher lipid accumulation in oncogene-expressing larvae compared to healthy ones.

However, by how much the biophysical components of tumour extracellular environment contribute to these processes is uncertain. In particular, the topographic environment is scarcely explored. The biophysical modulation of cell behaviour is primarily facilitated through mechanotransduction-associated mechanisms, including focal adhesion and Rho/ROCK signalling. Dysregulation of these pathways is commonly observed in ovarian cancer and, therefore, biophysical modulation of these mechanisms may be of great importance to ovarian cancer development and progression. In this work, aspects of the biophysical environment were explored using a bioimprinting technique. The study showed that topography-mediated substrate sensing delayed cell attachment, however, cell-cell interactions overrode the effect of topography in some cell lines, such as OVCAR-5. Also, 3D topographical cues were shown to modulate the inhibition of focal adhesion and Rho signalling, which resulted in higher MAPK activity in cells on the bioimprints. It was revealed that c-Src is vital to the biophysical modulation of cell proliferation and inhibition of c-Src could downregulate biophysically modulated MAPK activity. This study provides evidence that the biophysical extracellular environment affects key intracellular mechanisms associated with tumourigenicity in ovarian cancer cells."

Through this process, it is proposed that TRIP12 plays an oncogenic role in tumor initiation and growth. However, its role in other cancer processes is unknown. In this study, using publicly available cancer patient datasets, we found TRIP12 to be associated with distant metastasis-free survival in breast cancer, suggesting an inhibitory role in metastasis. Following TRIP12 depletion, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) shift occurred with concomitant changes in EMT cell adhesion markers identified through RNA-seq. In line with EMT changes, TRIP12-depleted cells gained mesenchymal traits such as loss of cell polarity, dislodgement from bulk cells at a higher frequency, and increased cellular motility. Furthermore, ectopic TRIP12 expression sensitized cells to anoikis. Mechanistically, TRIP12 suppresses EMT through inhibiting ZEB1/2 gene expression, and ZEB1/2 depletion rescues EMT markers and mesenchymal behavior. Overall, our study delineates TRIP12's role in inhibition of EMT and implies a potential suppressive role in breast cancer metastasis."

Recently, a bladder cancer genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screen correlated cisplatin sensitivity to multiple genetic biomarkers. Among the screen's top hits was the HECT domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase (HUWE1). In this review, HUWE1 is postulated as a therapeutic response modulator, affecting the collision between platinum-DNA adducts and the replication fork, the primary cytotoxic action of platins. HUWE1 can alter the cytotoxic response to platins by targeting essential components of the DNA damage response including BRCA1, p53, and Mcl-1. Deficiency of HUWE1 could lead to enhanced DNA damage repair and a dysfunctional apoptotic apparatus, thereby inducing resistance to platins. Future research on the relationship between HUWE1 and platins could generate new mechanistic insights into therapy resistance. Ultimately, HUWE1 might serve as a clinical biomarker to tailor cancer treatment strategies, thereby improving cancer care and patient outcomes."

Centrosome amplification mediates small extracellular vesicle secretion via lysosome disruption	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							PANCREATIC STELLATE CELLS; CANCER; EXOSOMES; TUMORIGENESIS; BIOLOGY; HETEROGENEITY; PROGRESSION; MECHANISM; RECEPTOR; TRIGGER	"Bidirectional communication between cells and their surrounding environment is critical in both normal and pathological settings. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate the horizontal transfer of molecules between cells, are recognized as an important constituent of cell-cell communication. In cancer, alterations in EV secretion contribute to the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here, we show that centrosome amplification is associated with and sufficient to promote small extracellular vesicle (SEV) secretion in pancreatic cancer cells. This is a direct result of lysosomal dysfunction, caused by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) downstream of extra centrosomes. We propose that defects in lysosome function could promote multivesicular body fusion with the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing SEV secretion. Furthermore, we find that SEVs secreted in response to amplified centrosomes are functionally distinct and activate pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). These activated PSCs promote the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in heterotypic 3D cultures. We propose that SEVs secreted by cancer cells with amplified centrosomes influence the bidirectional communication between the tumor cells and the surrounding stroma to promote malignancy."

Many perturbations, such as increased oxidative stress, pathogen infection, and inflammation, promote the accumulation of DNA mutations, and ultimately lead to carcinogenesis. Tea is one of the most highly consumed beverages worldwide and has been linked to improvements in human health. Tea contains many active components, including tea polyphenols, tea polysaccharides, L-theanine, tea pigments, and caffeine among other common components. Several studies have identified components in tea that can directly or indirectly reduce carcinogenesis with some being used in a clinical setting. Many previous studies, in vitro and in vivo, have focused on the mechanisms that functional components of tea utilized to protect against cancer. One particular mechanism that has been well described is an improvement in antioxidant capacity seen with tea consumption. However, other mechanisms, including anti-pathogen, anti-inflammation and alterations in cell survival pathways, are also involved. The current review focuses on these anti-cancer mechanisms. This will be beneficial for clinical utilization of tea components in preventing and treating cancer in the future."

N-3 PUFAs have emerged as the strongest candidate for the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous studies have demonstrated that fish oil (FO) rich in n-3 PUFAs not only increased therapeutic potential of 5-Fluorouracil(5-FU) in colon cancer but also ameliorated its toxicity. Henceforth, the present study is designed to elucidate mechanistic insights of FO as a chemosensitizer to circumvent drug resistance in experimental colon carcinoma. The colon cancer was induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine(DMH)/dextran sulfate sodium(DSS) in male Balb/c mice and these animals were treated with 5-FU(12.5 mg/kg b.w.), FO(0.2 ml), or 5-FU + FO(12.5 mg/kg b.w + 0.2 ml) orally for 14 days. The molecular mechanism of overcoming 5-FU resistance using FO in colon cancer was delineated by estimating expression of cancer stem cell markers using flowcytometric method and drug transporters by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Additionally, distribution profile of 5-FU and its cytotoxic metabolite, 5-FdUMP at target(colon), and non-target sites (serum, kidney, liver, spleen) was assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) method. The observations revealed that expression of CSCs markers was remarkably reduced after using fish oil along with 5-FU in carcinogen-treated animals. Interestingly, the use of FO alongwith 5-FU also significantly declined the expression of drug transporters (ABCB1,ABCC5) and consequently resulted in an increased cellular uptake of 5-FU and its metabolite, 5-FdUMP at target site (colon). It could be possibly associated with change in permeability of cell membrane owing to the alteration in membrane fluidity. The present study revealed the mechanistic insights of FO as a MDR revertant which successfully restored 5-FU-mediated chemoresistance in experimental colon carcinoma."

Here, we report a direct regulatory mode between tumour cells and osteoclasts in metastatic niche of prostate cancer via vesicular miRNAs transfer. Combined analysis of miRNAs profiles both in tumour-derived small EVs (sEVs) and osteoclasts identified miR-152-3p as a potential osteolytic molecule. sEVs were enriched in miR-152-3p, which targets osteoclastogenic regulator MAFB. Blocking miR-152-3p in sEVs upregulated the expression of MAFB and impaired osteoclastogenesis in vitro. In vivo experiments of xenograft mouse model found that blocking of miR-152-3p in sEVs significantly slowed down the loss of trabecular architecture, while systemic inhibition of miR-152-3p using antagomir-152-3p reduced the osteolytic lesions of cortical bone while preserving basic trabecular architecture.

Starting from an initial cancer stem cell (CSC0), similar to an embryonic stem cell (ESC), after implantation in a niche, primary self-renewing CSCs (CSC(1)s) would arise, which then generate secondary proliferating CSCs (CSC(2)s). From these epithelial CSCs, tertiary mesenchymal CSCs (CSC(3)s) would arise, which, under favorable stereotrophic conditions, by asymmetric proliferation, would generate cancer progenitor cells (CPCs) and then cancer differentiated cells (CDCs), thus giving a defined cell heterogeneity and hierarchy. CSC(1)s-CSC(2)s-CSC(3)s-CPCs-CDCs would constitute a defined tumor growth module, able to generate new tumor modules, forming a spherical avascular mass, similar to a tumor sphere. Further growth in situ of this initial tumor would require implantation in the host and vascularization through the overexpression of some aspecific checkpoint molecules, such as CD44, ID, LIF, HSP70, and HLA-G. To expand and spread in the host tissues, this vascularized tumor would then carry on a real growth strategy based on other specific checkpoint factors, such as those contained in the extracellular vesicles (EVs), namely, microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and integrins. These EV components would be crucial in tumor progression because they can mediate intercellular communications in the surrounding microenvironment and systemically, dictating to recipient cells a new tumor-enslaved phenotype, thus determining pre-metastatic conditions. Moreover, by their induction properties, the EV contents could also frustrate in time the effects of cytolytic tumor therapies, where EVs released by killed CSCs might enter other cancer and non-cancer cells, thus giving chemoresistance, non-CSC/CSC transition (recurrence), and metastasis. Thus, antitumor cytotoxic treatments, shielded from the EV-specific checkpoints by suitable adjuvant agents, simultaneously targeting the aforesaid aspecific checkpoints should be necessary for dismantling the hierarchic tumor structure, avoiding recurrence and preventing metastasis."

In the present study, we demonstrate that CaSR promotes expression of Rab27B and activates this secretory small GTPase via PI3K, PKA, mTOR and MADD, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, also known as DENN/Rab3GEP. Active Rab27B leads secretion of various cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-8, IP-10 and RANTES. Expression of Rab27B is stimulated by CaSR in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast epithelial cancer cells, but not in non-cancerous MCF-10A cells. This regulatory mechanism also occurs in HeLa and PC3 cells.

We find that disruption of the MSL complex and consequent loss of the associated H4K16ac mark do not substantially alter transcriptional programmes but compromise chromosome integrity and promote chromosomal instability (CIN) that progressively exhausts the proliferative potential of cancer cells through a p53-independent mechanism. This effect is dependent on pre-existing genomic instability, and normal cells are insensitive to MSL disruption. Using cell- and patient-derived xenografts from multiple cancer types, we show that excessive CIN induced by MSL disruption inhibits tumour maintenance. Our findings suggest that targeting MSL may be a valuable means to increase CIN beyond the level tolerated by cancer cells without inducing severe adverse effects in normal tissues."

Methods To systematically determine CK18 expression in normal and cancerous tissues, 11,952 tumor samples from 115 different tumor types and subtypes (including carcinomas, mesenchymal and biphasic tumors) as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. Results CK18 was expressed in normal epithelial cells of most organs but absent in normal squamous epithelium. At least an occasional weak CK18 positivity was seen in 90 of 115 (78.3%) tumor types. Wide-spread CK18 positivity was seen in 37 (31.9%) of tumor entities, including adenocarcinomas of the lung, prostate, colon and pancreas as well as ovarian cancer. Tumor categories with variable CK18 immunostaining included cancer types arising from CK18 positive precursor cells but show CK18 downregulation in a fraction of cases, tumor types arising from CK18 negative precursor cells occasionally exhibiting CK18 neo-expression, tumors derived from normal tissues with variable CK18 expression, and tumors with a mixed differentiation. CK18 downregulation was for example seen in renal cell cancers and breast cancers, whereas CK18 neo-expression was found in squamous cell carcinomas of various origins. Down-regulation of CK18 in invasive breast carcinomas of no special type and clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) was related to adverse tumor features in both tumors (p <= 0.0001) and poor patient prognosis in ccRCC (p = 0.0088). Up-regulation of CK18 in squamous cell carcinomas was linked to high grade and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). In summary, CK18 is consistently expressed in various epithelial cancers, especially adenocarcinomas. Conclusions Down-regulation or loss of CK18 expression in cancers arising from CK18 positive tissues as well as CK18 neo-expression in cancers originating from CK18 negative tissues is linked to cancer progression and may reflect tumor dedifferentiation."

However, numerous reports are showing that the function of the enzyme goes far beyond chromosome ends. The study aimed to explore how telomerase downregulation in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells affects their ability to survive. Consequently, sensitivity to drug resistance, proliferation, and adhesion were assessed. The lentiviral-mediated human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) downregulation efficiency was performed at gene expression and protein level using qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Telomerase activity was evaluated using the Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) assay. The study revealed that hTERT downregulation led to an increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin which was demonstrated in MTT and clonogenic assays. During a long-term doubling time assessment, a decreased population doubling level was observed. Interestingly, it did not dramatically affect cell cycle distribution. hTERT downregulation was accompanied by an alteration in beta 1-integrin- and by focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-driven pathways together with the reduction of target proteins phosphorylation, i.e., paxillin and c-Src. Additionally, autophagy activation was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells manifested by alternations in Atg5, Beclin 1, LC3II/I ratio, and p62. These results provide new evidence supporting the possible therapeutic potential of telomerase downregulation leading to induction of autophagy and cancer cells elimination."

This study aimed to screen the expression profiles of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA of ovarian cancer cells induced by Torin 1 (10 mu M). The expression profiles of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA were analyzed with next-generation sequencing technology. CircRAB11FIP1 expression was elevated in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues than in normal ovarian tissues. Silencing circRAB11FIP1 inhibited the autophagic flux of ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells. However, circRAB11FIP1 overexpression activated the autophagic flux of ovarian cancer A2780 cells. CircRAB11FIP1-induced autophagy accelerated EOC proliferation and invasion. Also, circRAB11FIP1 directly bound to miR-129 and regulated its targets ATG7 and ATG14. CircRAB11FIP1 bound to desmocollin 1to facilitate its interaction with ATG101. Also, circRAB11FIP1 directly bound to the mRNA of fat mass and obesity-associated protein and promoted its expression. Then, circRAB11FIP1 mediated mRNA expression levels of ATG5 and ATG7 depending on m6A. In general, this study demonstrated that circRAB11FIP1 regulated ATG7 and ATG14 by sponging miR-129.

The urothelium has a very slow turnover under normal conditions but is capable of extremely fast response to injury. During regeneration urothelium either restores normal function or undergoes altered differentiation pathways, the latter being the cause of several bladder diseases. In this review, we describe the structure of the apical plasma membrane that enables barrier function, the role of urothelium specific proteins uroplakins and the machinery for polarized membrane transports in terminally differentiated superficial umbrella cells. We address key markers, such as keratins, cancer stem cell markers, retinoic acid signalling pathway proteins and transient receptor potential channels and purinergic receptors that drive normal and altered differentiation in bladder cancer and bladder pain syndrome. Finally, we discuss uncertainties regarding research, diagnosis and treatment of bladder pain syndrome. Throughout the review, we emphasise the contribution of immunohistochemistry in advancing our understanding of processes in normal and diseased bladder as well as the most promising possibilities for improved bladder cancer and bladder pain syndrome management."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous, and non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in the progression of various types of tumor. Our aim of this study was to find the regulatory function of microRNA-26 (miRNA-26b) on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian CSCs. Our studies show that miR-26b is under-regulated in human CD117(+)CD44(+) ovarian CSCs. The miR-26b overexpression inhibits the cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis.

The main purpose of this study is to strengthen the application of non-oncological drug metformin on breast cancer treatment in the perspective of epigenetics. In the present study, metformin was found to inhibit cell proliferation, promote apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells at a dose-dependent manner. In addition, metformin treatment elevated acH3K9 abundance and decreased acH3K18 level. The expression of lncRNA MALAT1, HOTAIR, DICER1-AS1, LINC01121 and TUG1 was up-regulated by metformin treatment. In metformin-treated cells, MALAT1 knock-down increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and enhanced p21 but decreased cyclin B1 expression. The expression of Beclin1, VDAC1, LC3-II, CHOP and Bip was promoted in the cells received combinatorial treatment of metformin and MALAT1 knock-down.

Members in FZD family including FZD2, FZD4, FZD7, FZD8 and FZD10 have been demonstrated to mediate cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Methods: CCLE and TCGA databases were interrogated to reveal the association of FZD5 with EMT. EMT was analyzed by investigating the alterations in CDH1 (E-cadherin), VIM (Vimentin) and ZEB1 expression, cell migration and cell morphology. Transcriptional modulation was determined by ChIP in combination with Real-time PCR. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In contrast to other FZDs, FZD5 was identified to prevent EMT in gastric cancer. FZD5 maintains epithelial-like phenotype and is negatively modulated by transcription factors SNAI2 and TEAD1. Epithelial-specific factor ELF3 is a downstream effecter, and protein kinase C (PKC) links FZD5 to ELF3. ELF3 represses ZEB1 expression, further guarding against EMT. Moreover, FZD5 signaling requires its co-receptor LRP5 and WNT7B is a putative ligand for FZD5. FZD5 and ELF3 are associated with longer survival, whereas SNAI2 and TEAD1 are associated with shorter survival. Conclusions: Taken together, FZD5-ELF3 signaling blocks EMT, and plays a potential tumor-suppressing role in gastric cancer."

Altered redox balance and consequent disruption of redox signaling are implicated in the proliferation and progression of cancer cells and their resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. The nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor (Nrf2) is the principal stress-responsive transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Aberrant Nrf2 overactivation has been observed in many cancerous and transformed cells. Uncontrolled amplification of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant signaling results in reductive stress. Some metabolic pathways altered due to reductive stress have been identified as major contributors to tumorigenesis. This review highlights the multifaceted role of reductive stress in cancer development and progression."

Phytocannabinoids, endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids activate two major G protein-coupled receptors, subtype 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2). Cannabinoids (CBs) modulate several aspects of cancer cells, such as apoptosis, autophagy, proliferation, migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness. Moreover, agonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors inhibit angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of cancer in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which contains a plethora of innate and adaptive immune cells. These cells play a central role in tumor initiation and growth and the formation of metastasis. CB2 and, to a lesser extent, CB1 receptors are expressed on a variety of immune cells present in TME (e.g., T cells, macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, eosinophils). The activation of CB receptors modulates a variety of biological effects on cells of the adaptive and innate immune system. The expression of CB2 and CB1 on different subsets of immune cells in TME and hence in tumor development is incompletely characterized. The recent characterization of the human cannabinoid receptor CB2-G(i) signaling complex will likely aid to design potent and specific CB2/CB1 ligands with therapeutic potential in cancer."

Radiotherapy is a common local therapeutic modality for HNC mainly through the function of ionizing radiation, with approximately 60% of patients treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Although radiotherapy is more advanced and widely used in clinical practice, the 5-year overall survival rates of locally advanced HNCs are still less than 40%. HNC cell resistance to radiotherapy remains one of the major challenges to improve the overall survival in HNC patients. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are newly discovered functional small RNA molecules that are different from messenger RNAs, which can be translated into a protein. Many previous studies have reported the dysregulation and function of ncRNAs in HNC. Importantly, researchers reported that several ncRNAs were also dysregulated in radiotherapy-sensitive or radiotherapy-resistant HNC tissues compared with the normal cancer tissues. They found that ectopically elevating or knocking down expression of some ncRNAs could significantly influence the response of HNC cancer cells to radiotherapy, indicating that ncRNAs could regulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiotherapy. The implying mechanism for ncRNAs in regulating radiotherapy sensitivity may be due to its roles on affecting DNA damage sensation, inducing cell cycle arrest, regulating DNA damage repair, modulating cell apoptosis, etc. Additionally, clinical studies reported that in situ ncRNA expression in HNC tissues may predict the response of radiotherapy, and circulating ncRNA from body liquid serves as minimally invasive therapy-responsive and prognostic biomarkers in HNC. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current function and mechanism of ncRNAs in regulating the sensitivity of HNC cancer cells to radiotherapy and comprehensively described the state of the art on the role of ncRNAs in the prognosis prediction, therapy monitoring, and prediction of response to radiotherapy in HNC."

Aberrant regulation of autophagy is significantly associated with various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed that the coordinated regulation of histone and non-histone protein modification is associated with autophagy. In this review, we highlight the recent progress that has been made in elucidating the molecular basis of protein methylation and acetylation associated with autophagy at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels.

Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, NME1/NM23-H1, has been identified as a metastasis suppressor; however, its contribution to local invasion in breast cancer is not known. Here, we report that NME1 is up-regulated in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as compared to normal breast epithelial tissues. NME1 levels drop in microinvasive and invasive components of breast tumor cells relative to synchronous DCIS foci. We find a strong anti-correlation between NME1 and plasma membrane MT1-MMP levels in the invasive components of breast tumors, particularly in aggressive histological grade III and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockout of NME1 accelerates the invasive transition of breast tumors in the intraductal xenograft model. At the mechanistic level, we find that MT1-MMP, NME1 and dynamin-2, a GTPase known to require GTP production by NME1 for its membrane fission activity in the endocytic pathway, interact in clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. Loss of NME1 function increases MT1-MMP surface levels by inhibiting endocytic clearance. As a consequence, the ECM degradation and invasive potentials of breast cancer cells are enhanced. This study identifies the down-modulation of NME1 as a potent driver of the in situ-to invasive transition during breast cancer progression."

Cell viability assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and tumor xenograft growth assay were conducted. We found that AgIV significantly decreased the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of carboplatin in prostate cancer cell lines LNCap and PC-3. Moreover, AgIV enhanced the effect of carboplatin in suppressing colony formation and inducing cell apoptosis. A low-dose carboplatin treatment upregulated N-cadherin and Vimentin expression and downregulated E-cadherin expression, but this effect was abolished by combining with AgIV. Carboplatin treatment increased the levels of p-AKT and p-p65 and decreased p-I kappa B alpha, but AgIV treatment suppressed this. In addition, AgIV synergized with carboplatin to suppress tumor xenograft growth of PC-3 cells, and decreased pAKT and p-p65 levels in vivo. Our results suggested that AgIV enhanced carboplatin sensitivity in prostate cancer cell lines by suppressing AKT/NF-kappa B signaling, thus suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by carboplatin.

Aurora-A kinase oncogenic signaling mediates TGF-beta-induced triple-negative breast cancer plasticity and chemoresistance	ONCOGENE			English	Article								"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBCs) account for 15-20% of all breast cancers and represent the most aggressive subtype of this malignancy. Early tumor relapse and progression are linked to the enrichment of a sub-fraction of cancer cells, termed breast tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), that undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and typically exhibit a basal-like CD44(high)/CD24(low) and/or ALDH1(high) phenotype with critical cancer stem-like features such as high self-renewal capacity and intrinsic (de novo) resistance to standard of care chemotherapy. One of the major mechanisms responsible for the intrinsic drug resistance of BTICs is their high ALDH1 activity leading to inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that aurora-A kinase (AURKA) is required to mediate TGF-beta-induced expression of the SNAI1 gene, enrichment of ALDH1(high) BTICs, self-renewal capacity, and chemoresistance in TNBC experimental models. Significantly, the combination of docetaxel (DTX) with dual TGF-beta and AURKA pharmacologic targeting impaired tumor relapse and the emergence of distant metastasis. We also showed in unique chemoresistant TNBC cells isolated from patient-derived TNBC brain metastasis that dual TGF-beta and AURKA pharmacologic targeting reversed cancer plasticity and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to DTX-based-chemotherapy. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time the critical role of AURKA oncogenic signaling in mediating TGF-beta-induced TNBC plasticity, chemoresistance, and tumor progression."

The cardiac glycoside oleandrin, which inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase pump (NKP), has been shown to suppress breast cancer growth via inducing apoptosis. In the present study, we showed that oleandrin treatment triggered breast cancer cell ICD by inducing calreticulin (CRT) exposure on cell surface and the release of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), heat shock protein 70/90 (HSP70/90), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) were increased by co-culturing with the oleandrin-treated cancer cells, which subsequently enhanced CD8(+) T cell cytotoxicity. Murine breast cancer cell line EMT6 was engrafted into BALB/c mice, and tumor-bearing mice were administered with oleandrin intraperitoneally every day. Oleandrin inhibited tumor growth and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes including DCs and T cells. Furthermore, the differential mRNA expression incurred by oleandrin was investigated by mRNA sequencing and subsequently confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Mechanistically, oleandrin induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated, caspase-independent ICD mainly through PERK/elF2 alpha /ATF4/CHOP pathway. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) suppressed oleandrin-triggered ICD. Taken together, our findings showed that oleandrin triggered ER stress and induced ICD-mediated immune destruction of breast cancer cells. Oleandrin combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors might improve the efficacy of immunotherapy."

In our research, A549 and SK-MES-1 were used to assess the effect of three-dimensional (3D) culture compared to that of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, response to chemotherapy, as well as the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related markers. As tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with the potential to target CSC maintenance in multiple cancer cell lines, we assessed its function in 3D culture and detected the downstream pathway genes. Methods: We compared the viability and proliferation capacity of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells in 2D and 3D culture by cell counting kit (CCK)-8, foci formation, and Live/Dead double stain (Operetta CLS High content screening). Migration, invasion, and other functions were also assessed. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, the expression of EMT and CSC markers was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot. Results: A549 and SK-MES-1 cells formed spheroids heterogeneous in shape and size. In our 3D spheroid systems, cells went through EMT, and were also capacitated with higher stemness and chemoresistance. Combination use of tadalafil and cisplatin showed higher chemotherapy efficiency in the 3D model, compared to that of the 2D cell culture. Conclusion: Our research aims at the notable differences between these two cellular systems in terms of cell functions, EMT, and stemness-associated gene expression and chemo-response. We showed that a commonly used drug, tadalafil, showed more pronounced inhibitory effects when cells were cultured in the 3D model. Since the 3D culture system could imitate the in vivo behavior of cancer cells within the tumor, we advocate that this system is superior to traditional 2D culture and should be used in the investigation of new therapeutic compounds."

In this study, we performed a pan-cancer survey to demonstrate the role of Fuz in multiple types of cancer. In head-neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma tumor samples, a reduction of Fuz transcript expression was detected. This coincides with the poor overall survival probabilities of these patients. We further showed that Fuz promoter hypermethylation contributes to its transcriptional downregulation. Meanwhile, we also identified a relatively higher mutation frequency at the 404th arginine amino acid residue in the coding sequence of Fuz locus, and further demonstrated that mutant Fuz proteins perturb the pro-apoptotic function of Fuz.

Although these two diseases seem to be distinct from each other, increasing evidence suggests that they might be linked. To explore the linkage between these two diseases, differentially expressed genes between the diseased people and their normal controls were identified using the barcode algorithm. This algorithm transforms actual gene expression values into barcode values comprised of 1's (expressed genes) and 0's (silenced genes). Once the overlapped differentially expressed genes were identified, their biological relevance was investigated. Thus, using the gene expression profiles and bioinformatics methods, we demonstrate that Parkinson's disease and gastric cancer are indeed linked.

This study aims to determine the association between immune cell infiltration and malignant gynecological tumors and construct signatures for diagnosis and prognosis. Methods We acquired malignant gynecological tumor RNA-seq transcriptome data from the TCGA database. Next, the CIBERSORT algorithm calculated the infiltration of 22 immune cells in malignant gynecological tumors. To construct diagnosis and prognosis signatures, step-wise regression and LASSO analyses were applied, and nomogram and immune subtypes were further identified. Results Notably, Immune cell infiltration plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and development. There are obvious differences in the distribution of immune cells in normal, and tumor tissues. Resting NK cells, M0 Macrophages, and M1 Macrophages participated in the construction of the diagnostic model, with an AUC value of 0.898. LASSO analyses identified a risk signature including T cells CD8, activated NK cells, Monocytes, M2 Macrophages, resting Mast cells, and Neutrophils, proving the prognostic value for the risk signature. We identified two subtypes according to consensus clustering, where immune subtype 3 presented the highest risk. Conclusion We identified diagnostic and prognostic signatures based on immune cell infiltration. Thus, this study provided a strong basis for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of malignant gynecological tumors."

As the host genes of the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), they are commonly localized in the nucleolus, where they exert multiple regulatory functions orchestrating cellular homeostasis and differentiation as well as metastasis and chemoresistance. Indeed, worldwide literature has reported their involvement in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of different histotypes of cancer, being able to exploit peculiar features, for example, the possibility to act both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, SNHGs regulation is a fundamental topic to better understand their role in tumor progression albeit such mechanism is still debated. Here, we reviewed the biological functions of SNHGs in particular in the EMT process and discussed the perspectives for new cancer therapies."

Besides predominant research in the cilia field, some IFT subunits perform extraciliary roles in non-ciliated cancer cells. However, the specific roles of IFT subunits in tumorigenesis remain unknown. Here, we found that knockout of IFT20 in mouse breast cancer cells lacking primary cilia promoted epithelial mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), active lamellipodia formation, and cell migration. IFT20 localized at the trans-Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN), and displayed vesicular co-distributions with Rab8a, the marker of TGN-to-plasma membrane vesicular trafficking. Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and colocalization analyzes showed that Numb and Ctnnal1, whose depletion promoted cell migration, co-localized with IFT20 at the trans-Golgi/TGN or intracellular transport vesicles. Furthermore, Strep-Tactin pulldown assays revealed an interaction between IFT20 and Ctnnal1 or Numb. Loss of IFT20 lowered the expression of actin-associated Tagln2, whose knockdown promoted cell migration. Thus, the extraciliary function of ITF20 in breast cancer cell was associated with the negative regulation of migration."

While M1-polarized macrophages generally mediate rapid immune responses, M2-polarized macrophages induce chronic and mild immune responses. In either case, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediators act as both products and regulators of macrophages. Prostaglandin E-3 (PGE(3)) is an eicosanoid derived from eicosapentaenoic acid, which is converted by cyclooxygenase, followed by prostaglandin E synthase successively. We found that PGE(3) played an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting LPS and interferon-gamma-induced M1 polarization and promoting interleukin-4-mediated M2 polarization (M2a). Further, we found that although PGE(3) had no direct effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, PGE(3) could inhibit prostate cancer in vivo in a nude mouse model of neoplasia. Notably, we found that PGE(3) significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in a cancer cell-macrophage co-culture system. Experimental results showed that PGE(3) inhibited the polarization of tumour-associated M2 macrophages (TAM), consequently producing indirect anti-tumour activity. Mechanistically, we identified that PGE(3) regulated the expression and activation of protein kinase A, which is critical for macrophage polarization. In summary, this study indicates that PGE(3) can selectively promote M2a polarization, while inhibiting M1 and TAM polarization, thus exerting an anti-inflammatory effect and anti-tumour effect in prostate cancer."

Methods In the current study, we investigated TNF-alpha modulated mitochondrial proteome using high-resolution mass spectrometry and identified the differentially expressed proteins in two different breast cancer cell lines, ER/PR positive cell line; luminal, MCF-7 and ER/PR negative cell line; basal-like, MDA-MB-231 and explored its implication in regulating the tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells. We also compared the activity of mitochondrial complexes, ATP, and ROS levels between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 in the presence of TNF-alpha. We used Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) webserver to analyze the correlation between TNF-alpha and mitochondrial proteins in basal and luminal breast cancer patients. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the correlation between mitochondrial protein expression and survival of breast cancer patients. Results The proteome analysis revealed that TNF-alpha differentially altered the level of critical proteins of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes both in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, which correlated with differential assembly and activity of mitochondrial ETC complexes. The inhibition of the glycolytic pathway in the presence of TNF-alpha showed that glycolysis is indispensable for the proliferation and clonogenic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells (ER/PR -ve) as compared to MCF-7 cells (ER/PR +ve). The TIMER database showed a negative correlation between the expressions of TNF-alpha and key regulators of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes in basal breast vs lobular carcinoma. Conversely, patient survival analysis showed an improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of identified proteins of ETC complexes and survival of the breast cancer patients. Conclusion The evidence presented in our study convincingly demonstrates that TNF-alpha regulates the survival and proliferation of aggressive tumor cells by modulating the levels of critical assembly factors and subunits involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes organization and function. This favors the rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism towards anaplerosis to support the survival and proliferation of breast cancer cells. Collectively, the results strongly suggest that TNF-alpha differentially regulates metabolic adaptation in ER/PR +ve (MCF-7) and ER/PR -ve (MDA-MB-231) cells by modulating the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly and activity."

Infection with HPV is essential for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In addition, estrogen receptor signaling is implicated in the development of cervical cancer. Previously, we have isolated human wings apart-like (WAPL), which is expected to cause chromosomal instability in the process of HPV-infected precancerous lesions to cervical cancer. However, the role of WAPL in the development of CIN is still unknown. In this study, in order to elucidate the role of WAPL in the early lesion, we established WAPL overexpressing mice (WAPL Tg mice) and HPV E6/E7 knock-in (KI) mice. WAPL Tg mice developed CIN lesion without HPV E6/E7. Interestingly, in WAPL Tg mice estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) showed reduction as compared with the wild type, but cell growth factors MYC and Cyclin D1 controlled by ESR1 expressed at high levels. These results suggested that WAPL facilitates sensitivity of ESR1 mediated by some kind of molecule, and as a result, affects the expression of MYC and Cyclin D1 in cervical cancer cells. To detect such molecules, we performed microarray analysis of the uterine cervix in WAPL Tg mice, and focused MACROD1, a co-activator of ESR1. MACROD1 expression was increased in WAPL Tg mice compared with the wild type. In addition, knockdown of WAPL induced the downregulation of MACROD1, MYC, and Cyclin D1 but not ESR1 expression. Furthermore, ESR1 sensitivity assay showed lower activity in WAPL or MACROD1 downregulated cells than control cells. These data suggested that WAPL increases ESR1 sensitivity by activating MACROD1, and induces the expression of MYC and Cyclin D1. Therefore, we concluded that WAPL not only induces chromosomal instability in cervical cancer tumorigenesis, but also plays a key role in activating estrogen receptor signaling in early tumorigenesis."

In order to improve patient outcomes, more efficient and targeted therapies are essential. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) express tumour homing capacity, which could be exploited to target anti-cancer drug delivery to the tumour region and reduce adverse side-effects. Nevertheless, dental pulp stromal cells (DPSCs), an MSC-like population present in teeth, could offer important clinical benefits because of their easy isolation and superior proliferation compared to BM-MSCs. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the tumour homing and safe usage of DPSCs to treat HNC. Methods The in vivo survival as well as the effect of intratumourally administered DPSCs on tumour aggressiveness was tested in a HNC xenograft mouse model by using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), (immuno)histology and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo tumour homing capacity of DPSCs towards a HNC cell line were evaluated by a transwell migration assay and BLI, respectively. Results Intratumourally injected DPSCs survived for at least two weeks in the tumour micro-environment and had no significant influence on tumour morphology, growth, angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In addition, DPSCs migrated towards tumour cells in vitro, which could not be confirmed after their in vivo intravenous, intraperitoneal or peritumoural injection under the tested experimental conditions. Conclusions Our research suggests that intratumourally delivered DPSCs might be used as safe factories for the continuous delivery of anti-cancer center dot drugs in HNC. Nevertheless, further optimization as well as efficacy studies are necessary to understand and improve in vivo tumour homing and determine the optimal experimental set-up of stem cell-based cancer therapies, including dosing and timing."

As a collection of biospecimens and annotated data collected to support a multitude of research projects, biobanks facilitate access to materials that are the critical fuel for the generation of data in up to 40% of cancer research publications. However, quantifying how to measure biobanks' impact and their value on the field of cancer research discoveries and findings, has not been well elucidated. Methods: We have used a qualitative case study approach to illustrate the impact of tumor biobanks. We assessed the impact of three research studies published between 2010 and 2012 that required easily accessible classic biobanks. Each study utilized preassembled collections of tumor biospecimens with associated patient outcomes data at the outset of the research project. We compared the resulting journal impact factor, altmetric and field-weighted citation impact factor scores for each article to a set of six benchmark articles that represent cancer research and treatment discoveries from the same time period and two sentinel scientific discovery articles. Results: We developed a value model using a literature search and design-thinking methodologies to illustrate the contributions of these classic model biobanks to these research studies. Assessment of the three example articles supported by biobanks demonstrates that the output can have impact that is comparable to the impact of a set of benchmark articles describing milestones in the field of cancer research and cancer care. Conclusions: These case studies illustrate the value of the sustained investment of funds, planning, time, and effort on the part of the biobanks before the conduct of the research study to be able to ultimately support high-value research. The value model will enable further discussion around impact and may be useful in better delineating qualitative metrics of biobank value in the future."

Meanwhile, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can secret exosomes to transfer miRNAs, which mediate tumour development. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of CAF-derived exosomal miR-24-3p in colon cancer (CC). Hence, this study intended to characterize the functional relevance of CAF-derived exosomal miR-24-3p in CC cell resistance to methotrexate (MTX). We identified differentially expressed HEPH, CDX2 and miR-24-3p in CC through bioinformatics analyses, and validated their expression in CC tissues and cells. The relationship among HEPH, CDX2 and miR-24-3p was verified using ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. Exosomes were isolated from miR-24-3p inhibitor-treated CAFs (CAFs-exo/miR-24-3p inhibitor), which were used in combination with gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments and MTX treatment. CCK-8, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were conducted to determine cell viability, apoptosis and colony formation, respectively. Based on the findings, CC tissues and cells presented with high expression of miR-24-3p and low expression of HEPH and CDX2. CDX2 was a target gene of miR-24-3p and could up-regulate HEPH. Under MTX treatment, overexpressed CDX2 or HEPH and down-regulated miR-24-3p reduced cell viability and colony formation and elevated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-24-3p was transferred into CC cells via CAF-derived exosomes. CAF-derived exosomal miR-24-3p inhibitor diminished cell viability and colony formation and increased cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibited tumour growth in vivo under MTX treatment. Altogether, CAF-derived exosomal miR-24-3p accelerated resistance of CC cells to MTX by down-regulating CDX2/HEPH axis."

However, the prognostic value of AWPPH in various cancers remains unclear. Methods: Comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI and Wangfang databases, and eligible studies were obtained according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) were applied to assess the clinical value of AWPPH expression for overall survival (OS) and clinicopathological features. Results: A total of 19 articles including 1699 cancer patients were included in the study. The pooled results demonstrated that evaluated AWPPH expression was positively related to a poorer overall survival of patients with cancers (HR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.44-2.14, P<0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that tumor type and sample size affect the predictive value of AWPPH on OS, whereas cut-off value and HR estimation method have no impact on it. In addition, the pooled data also showed that AWPPH was positively linked to advanced TNM stage (OR = 2.50, 95%CI: 1.94-3.22, P<0.001), bigger tumor size (OR = 2.64, 95%CI: 1.47-4.73, P=0.001), macro-vascular invasion (OR = 2.08, 95%CI: 1.04-4.16, P=0.04) and lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.68, 95%CI: 1.82-3.96, P<0.001). Moreover, the results of the trim and fill analysis confirmed the reliability of our finding. Conclusions: Up-regulation of AWPPH was associated with advanced TNM stage, bigger tumor size, worse lymph node metastasis, macro-vascular invasion and shorter overall survival, suggesting that AWPPH may serve as a biomarker for prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics in human cancers among the Chinese population."

Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) is known to affect Ub E3 ligases (E3s) in liver cancer. However, whether TRIB2 regulates the UPS in other ways and the relevant mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we reveal that TRIB2 decreased Ub levels largely by stimulating proteasome degradation of Ub. In the proteasome, proteasome 20S subunit beta 5 (PSMB5) was critical for the function of TRIB2, although it did not directly interact with TRIB2. However, poly (rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), which was identified by mass spectrometry, directly interacted with both TRIB2 and PSMB5. PCBP2 was a prerequisite for the TRIB2 induction of PSMB5 activity and decreased Ub levels. A significant correlation between TRIB2 and PCBP2 was revealed in liver cancer specimens. Interestingly, TRIB2 suppressed the K48-ubiquitination of PCBP2 to increase its level. Therefore, a model showing that TRIB2 cooperates and stimulates PCBP2 to reduce Ub levels was established. Additionally, the reduction in Ub levels induced by TRIB2 and PCBP2 was dependent on K48-ubiquitination. PCBP2 was one of the possible downstream factors of TRIB2 and their interaction relied on the DQLVPD element of TRIB2 and the KH3 domain of PCBP2. This interaction was necessary to maintain the viability of the liver cancer cells and promote tumor growth. Mechanistically, glutathione peroxidase 4 functioned as one of the terminal effectors of TRIB2 and PCBP2 to protect liver cancer cells from oxidative damage. Taken together, the data indicate that, in addition to affecting E3s, TRIB2 plays a critical role in regulating UPS by modulating PSMB5 activity in proteasome to reduce Ub flux, and that targeting TRIB2 might be helpful in liver cancer treatments by enhancing the oxidative damage induced by therapeutic agents."

However, the mechanisms underlying HR regulation remain largely unknown. Cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP1) is a member of the LIM/double-zinc finger protein family and is overexpressed and associated with prognosis in several tumor types. However, to date, the functional role of CRIP1 in cancer biology is poorly understood. Here we found that CRIP1 downregulation causes HR repair deficiency with concomitant increase in cell sensitivity to cisplatin, epirubicin, and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, upon DNA damage, CRIP1 is deubiquitinated and upregulated by activated AKT signaling. CRIP1, in turn, promotes nuclear enrichment of RAD51, which is a prerequisite step for HR commencement, by stabilizing BRCA2 to counteract FBXO5-targeted RAD51 degradation and by binding to the core domain of RAD51 (RAD51(184-257)) in coordination with BRCA2, to facilitate nuclear export signal masking interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. Moreover, through mass spectrometry screening, we found that KPNA4 is at least one of the carriers controlling the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of the CRIP1-BRCA2-RAD51 complex in response to chemotherapy. Consistent with these findings, RAD51 inhibitors block the CRIP1-mediated HR process, thereby restoring chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer cells with high CRIP1 expression. Analysis of patient specimens revealed an abnormally high level of CRIP1 expression in GC tissues compared to that in the adjacent normal mucosa and a significant negative association between CRIP1 expression and survival time in patient cohorts with different types of solid tumors undergoing genotoxic treatments. In conclusion, our study suggests an essential function of CRIP1 in promoting HR repair and facilitating gastric cancer cell adaptation to genotoxic therapy."

Smac-mimetic enhances antitumor effect of standard chemotherapy in ovarian cancer models via Caspase 8-independent mechanism	CELL DEATH DISCOVERY			English	Article							ACTIVATION; APOPTOSIS	"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer in the US. Standard treatment consists of surgery followed by chemotherapies relying on apoptotic tumor cell death. Most women with advanced stage disease will relapse, suggesting that this disease is characterized by primary and acquired resistance to chemotherapy, and novel approaches to treatment are greatly needed. Low Caspase 8 expression levels in ovarian cancers correlate with resistance to apoptotic chemotherapy, and a subpopulation of patients with low Caspase 8 levels exhibit poorer overall survival after standard-of-care treatment. We hypothesized that low Caspase 8 function reduces the ability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis when exposed to standard chemotherapy and that second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)-mimetics could increase cell death in combination with chemotherapy. Here we show that combination treatment with a Smac-mimetic can target tumor cells with low Caspase 8 and induce necroptotic cell death. We investigated the in vitro effect of Smac-mimetic added to carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment of ovarian cancer cells expressing wild type and low Caspase 8 levels, which resulted in a 2-4-fold enhancement of cell death. Mice bearing subcutaneous or intraperitoneal ovarian xenografts showed greater aggressiveness of Caspase 8-deficient versus wild-type tumors; combined in vivo treatment with chemotherapy and Smac-mimetic resulted in >50% decrease in low Caspase 8 xenograft growth, as well as significantly enhanced overall survival, especially when given simultaneously with paclitaxel. Surprisingly, Smac-mimetic on the same day as carboplatin decreased mouse survival compared to when it was given on a sequential day of treatment. The antagonism was associated with a decrease in DNA damage markers, emphasizing the importance of optimizing timing of drug administration. Clinical validation of such approaches is needed to increase the effectiveness of current standard ovarian cancer treatment."

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) signaling pathway plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and is therefore considered a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of many cancers. Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) facilitates the expression of various genes and has been extensively studied for its potential role in cancer treatment. Methods The expression level of ATF5 in clinic sample was detected by quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. ATF5 biological function was investigated by western blot, cell cycle analysis, cell viability assay, luciferase reporter assays, colony formation assay, transwell assay, wound healing assay, tube formation assay, and ELISA assay. CHIP and Re-CHIP assay, GST-pulldown, and RNA-sequencing were used to study the cross-talks between ATF5 and HIF1 complex. Mouse xenograft study was utilized to study the correlation of ATF5 and tumor growth in vivo. Student's t-test or Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results Here, we first found ATF5 was dramatically upregulated in ESCA cancer and related with poor survival time. Next, we found that the expression level of ATF5 had a positive relationship with the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of ESCA cells. Besides, we innovatively found that ATF5 functions as a novel coactivator in HIF1 transcription complex by binding to HIF1 alpha. Further, we demonstrated that silencing ATF5 phenocopies HIF1 alpha knockdown in tumorigenic properties in vitro and inhibited ESCA tumor angiogenesis and proliferation in vivo. Conclusion Herein, we found ATF5 as a novel component of the HIF1 transcription complex. The findings of the present study may provide new insights into the development of a novel and more efficient therapeutic strategy against ESCA."

Since new evidence has recently suggested that metformin could target cancer stem cells (CSCs) and prevent their recurrence, repositioning of metformin could be considered as a candidate for anti-CSC agent. In this study, we assessed the effect of metformin on the cancer stem cells developed from induced pluripotent stem cells. As the result, metformin significantly suppressed the self-renewal ability of CSCs when assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and cell counting methods exhibiting the IC50 as approximately 20 mM, which suppressed tube formation by CSCs on Matrigel reducing the angiogenic potential of CSCs. Cell cycle analysis showed that metformin reduced the percentage of cells in the S phase increasing the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, the tumorigenicity of CSCs was found to be attenuated when the cells were injected with metformin. From these results, we concluded that metformin could be promising for targeted therapy by repositioning the widely available drugs with safety. Significance of the study Metformin could target CSCs and prevent their recurrence, repositioning of metformin could be considered as a candidate for the anti-CSC agent. In this paper, we assessed the effect of metformin on the CSCs developed from induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we show that metformin suppresses the self-renewal and tube formation abilities of CSCs. We also show that metformin reduces the percentage of cells in the S phase increasing the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase.

Epigenetic Reprogramming Mediated by Maternal Diet Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids Protects From Breast Cancer Development in F1 Offspring	FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						epigenetic changes; histone post-translational modification (PTM); maternal diet; breast cancer prevention; omega-3 fatty acids	N-3 FATTY-ACIDS; RATIO; OMEGA-3; INFLAMMATION; NUTRITION; GROWTH; RISK	"Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids (FA) have been associated with lowered risks of developing certain types of cancers. We earlier reported that in transgenic mice prone to develop breast cancer (BCa), a diet supplemented with canola oil, rich in omega-3-rich FA (as opposed to an omega-6-rich diet containing corn oil), reduced the risk of developing BCa, and also significantly reduced the incidence of BCa in F1 offspring. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the cancer protective effect of canola oil in the F1 generation, we designed and performed the present study with the same diets using BALB/c mice to remove any possible effect of the transgene. First, we observed epigenetic changes at the genome-wide scale in F1 offspring of mothers fed diets containing omega-3 FAs, including a significant increase in acetylation of H3K18 histone mark and a decrease in H3K4me2 mark on nucleosomes around transcription start sites. These epigenetic modifications contribute to differential gene expressions associated with various pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in preventing cancer development, including p53 pathway, G2M checkpoint, DNA repair, inflammatory response, and apoptosis. When offspring mice were exposed to 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), the group of mice exposed to a canola oil (with omega 3 FAs)-rich maternal diet showed delayed mortality, increased survival, reduced lateral tumor growth, and smaller tumor size. Remarkably, various genes, including BRCA genes, appear to be epigenetically re-programmed to poise genes to be ready for a rapid transcriptional activation due to the canola oil-rich maternal diet. This ability to respond rapidly due to epigenetic potentiation appeared to contribute to and promote protection against breast cancer after carcinogen exposure."

In a tumor microenvironment context, chemotactic cytokines are known to regulate the migration, positioning and interaction of different cell subsets with both anti- and pro-tumor functions. Additionally, chemokines have critical roles regarding non-immune cells, highlighting their importance in tumor growth and progression. CCL18 is a primate-specific chemokine produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. This chemokine presents both constitutive and inducible expression. It is mainly associated with a tolerogenic response and involved in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system under physiological conditions. Recently, CCL18 has been noticed as an important component of the complex chemokine system involved in the biology of tumors. This chemokine induces T regulatory cell differentiation and recruitment to the tumor milieu, with subsequent induction of a pro-tumor (M2-like) macrophage phenotype. CCL18 is also directly involved in cancer cell-invasion, migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis stimulation, pinpointing an important role in the promotion of cancer progression. Interestingly, this chemokine is highly expressed in tumor tissues, particularly at the invasive front of more advanced stages (e.g. colorectal cancer), and high levels are detected in the serum of patients, correlating with poor prognosis. Despite the promising role of CCL18 as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target to hamper disease progression, its pleiotropic functions in a context of cancer are still poorly explored. The scarce knowledge concerning the receptors for this chemokine, together with the insufficient insight on the downstream signaling pathways, have impaired the selection of this molecule as an immediate target for translational research. In this Review, we will discuss recent findings concerning the role of CCL18 in cancer, integrate recently disclosed molecular mechanisms and compile data from current clinical studies."

One reason for this may be that clinical trials ignore the complex vitamin D metabolome and the many active vitamin D3 metabolites present in the body. Recent work by our lab showed that 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3, a vitamin D-3 metabolite that is active in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, has antitumorigenic properties in estrogen receptor alpha-66 (ER alpha 66)-positive (ER+) breast cancer, but not in ER alpha 66-negative (ER+) breast cancer. Here we show that 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 is protumorigenic in an in vivo mouse model (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mice) of ER- breast cancer, causing greater tumor growth than in mice treated with vehicle alone. In vitro results indicate that the effect of 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 is via a membrane-associated mech- anism involving ERs and phospholipase D. 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis in ER alpha 66-negative HCC38 breast cancer cells, and stimulated expression of metastatic markers. Overexpressing ESRI, which encodes ER alpha 66, ER alpha 46, and ER alpha 36, reduced the proapoptotic response of ER alpha 66 - cells to 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3, possibly by upregulating ER alpha 66. Silencing ESR1 in ER alpha 66 cells increased apoptosis. This suggests 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 is differentially tumorigenic in cancers with different ER alpha isoform profiles. Antiapoptotic actions of 24R,25(OH)(2)D-3 require ER alpha 36 and proapoptotic actions require ER alpha 66."	"[Verma, Anjali; Cohen, D.

In this review, we address the role of CTAs in mitochondria (mitoCTAs), by reviewing all published data, and assessing the putative localization of CTAs by screening for the presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS).

To address this issue, in this study we investigated the correlation between inflammatory marker expression and survival in patients with advanced gastric and colorectal cancer. Data for 111 patients with advanced gastric and colorectal cancer treated with anti-PD-1 regimens were retrospectively analyzed. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and clinical characteristics of each patient were selected as the main variables. Overall response rate, disease control rate, and progression-free survival were primary endpoints, and overall survival and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were secondary endpoints. The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate relationships between categorical variables. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed, and median progression-free survival and overall survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The overall response rate and disease control rate of anti-PD-1therapy in advanced gastric and colorectal tumors were 12.61 and 66.66%, respectively. The patients with MLR < 0.31, NLR < 5, and PLR < 135 had a significantly higher disease control rate than those with MLR > 0.31, NLR > 5, and PLR > 135 (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis revealed that MLR < 0.31, BMI > 18.5, and anti-PD-1 therapy in first-line were associated with prolonged PFS. MLR < 0.31 and BMI > 18.5 were associated with prolonged overall survival. The irAE rate differed significantly between PLR groups, and PLR < 135 was associated with an increased rate of irAEs (P = 0.028). These results indicate that the inflammatory markers NLR, MLR, and PLR have clinical utility for predicting survival or risk of irAEs in patients with advanced gastric cancer and colorectal cancer."

Its high prevalence can be controlled through improved analysis and identification of disease-specific biomarkers. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as key contributors of carcinogenesis and regulate various cellular pathways through post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. The specific aim of this study was to identify the novel interactions of aberrantly expressed genetic components in breast cancer by applying integrative analysis of publicly available expression profiles of both lncRNAs and mRNAs. Differential expression patterns were identified by comparing the breast cancer expression profiles of samples with controls. Significant co-expression networks were identified through WGCNA analysis. WGCNA is a systems biology approach used to elucidate the pattern of correlation between genes across microarray samples. It is also used to identify the highly correlated modules. The results obtained from this study revealed significantly differentially expressed and co-expressed lncRNAs and their cis- and trans-regulating mRNA targets which include RP11-108F13.2 targeting TAF5L, RPL23AP2 targeting CYP4F3, CYP4F8 and AL022324.2 targeting LRP5L, AL022324.3, and Z99916.3, respectively. Moreover, pathway analysis revealed the involvement of identified mRNAs and lncRNAs in major cell signalling pathways, and target mRNAs expression is also validated through cohort data. Thus, the identified lncRNAs and their target mRNAs represent novel biomarkers that could serve as potential therapeutics for breast cancer and their roles could also be further validated through wet labs to employ them as potential therapeutic targets in future."

PDA cells exhibit aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, which reduces the flux of pyruvate into mitochondria. As a result, more glycolytic metabolites are shunted to pathways for the production of building blocks (e.g., ribose) and reducing agents (e.g., NADPH) for biosynthesis that are necessary for cell proliferation. In addition, PDA cells are highly addicted to glutamine for both maintaining biosynthetic pathways and achieving redox balance. Mitochondrial uncoupling facilitates proton influx across the mitochondrial inner membrane without generating ATP, leading to a futile cycle that consumes glucose metabolites and glutamine. We synthesized a new mitochondrial uncoupler MB1-47 and tested its effect on cancer cell metabolism and the anticancer activity in pancreatic cancer cell models and murine tumor transplantation models. MB1-47 uncouples mitochondria in the pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in: (1) the acceleration of pyruvate oxidation and TCA turnover; (2) increases in AMP/ATP and ADP/AMP ratios; and (3) a decrease in the synthesis rate of nucleotides and sugar nucleotides. Moreover, MB1-47 arrests cell cycle at G(0)-G(1) phase, reduces clonogenicity, and inhibits cell growth of murine and human pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo studies showed that MB1-47 inhibits tumor growth in murine tumor transplantation models, and inhibits the hepatic metastasis when tumor cells were transplanted intrasplenically. Our results provide proof of concept for a potentially new strategy of treating PDA, and a novel prototype experimental drug for future studies and development."

Anticancer drugs may themselves act as stressors to induce the cellular adaptive mechanism that can minimize their cytotoxicity. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) as cytoprotective factors can counteract the deleterious effects of various stressful stimuli. In this study, we examined whether the anticancer effects of MA can be counteracted by the mechanism related to HSPs belonging to the HSPA (HSP70) family. We found that MA caused cell type-specific alterations in the levels of HSPAs. These changes included concomitant upregulation of the stress-inducible (HSPA1 and HSPA6) and downregulation of the non-stress-inducible (HSPA2) paralogs. However, neither HSPA1 nor HSPA2 were necessary to provide protection against MA in lung cancer cells. Conversely, the simultaneous repression of several HSPA paralogs using pan-HSPA inhibitors (VER-155008 or JG-98) sensitized cancer cells to MA. We also observed that genetic ablation of the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription factor, a main transactivator of HSPAs expression, sensitized MCF7 cells to MA treatment. Our study reveals that inhibition of HSF1-mediated heat shock response (HSR) can improve the anticancer effect of MA. These observations suggest that targeting the HSR- or HSPA-mediated adaptive mechanisms may be a promising strategy for further preclinical developments."

Therefore, the prognostic value and underlying mechanism of CXCL11 in CRC were preliminarily evaluated. Three independent datasets were used for mRNA-related analysis: one dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 451) and two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE146771 and GSE132465. In addition, a colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patient cohort (the Yijishan Hospital cohort, YJSHC, n = 108) was utilized for analysis of cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry. We determined the distribution of CXCL11 in tumor tissue across all TCGA cancers and found that CXCL11 expression was significantly upregulated in both COAD and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ). However, the upregulation of CXCL11 mRNA was associated with a better prognosis in COAD, but not in READ. Within the YJSHC, the patients with a high abundance of intratumoral CXCL11(+) cells had prolonged survival (p = 0.001). Furthermore, we found that the high CXCL11 expression group had a higher proportion of antitumor immune cells, and a lower proportion of protumor immune cells. Additionally, we discovered the changes of gene expression and enriched immune pathway network mediated by CXCL11. Interestingly, both cytotoxic genes (IFNG, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMM, and PRF1) and immunosuppressive molecules, including PD-L1, were positively correlated with CXCL11 expression. CXCL11, which promoted antitumor immunity to benefit survival, was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with COAD."

A previous report showed that baicalin attenuates cisplatin resistance in lung cancer. However, its mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of baicalin on DNA repair and sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin. A549 and A549/DPP cells were treated with baicalin and cisplatin. A549/DPP cells were transfected with XRCC1 and siXRCC1. Cell viability and DNA damage were detected by MTT and comet assay. Apoptosis rate and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry assay. The expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and Cyclin D1 were detected by western blot. XRCC1 expression was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot. Baicalin and cisplatin decreased cell viability in A549 and A549/DPP cells in dose-dependent manner. Baicalin enhanced the effect of cisplatin on promoting apoptosis, arresting cell on S stage and triggering DNA damage accompanied with the upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Cyclin D1 in A549/DPP cells. Moreover, baicalin promoted the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on XRCC1 expression in A549 and A549/DPP cells.

However, its relationship with human immunity is unclear. This article aims to study its differential expression and survival across cancers and explore the relationships between its differential expression and the tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration. In this study, we used R software to process The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and explored the expression pattern and prognostic value of ZBTB7C across cancers. Next, we comprehensively explained the important role of ZBTB7C in several tumor types in terms of tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) and immune cell infiltration. In general, the expression level of ZBTB7C in tumor tissues was lower than that in normal tissues. Highly expressed ZBTB7C was beneficial to the survival of patients with colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), lymphoid neoplasm diffuses large B cell lymphoma (DLBC), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) and mesothelioma (MESO). Multivariate analysis showed that the expression of ZBTB7C was an independent prognostic factor in COAD and MESO. In COAD, the expression of ZBTB7C was positively correlated with both TMB and MSI. In colorectal cancer (CRC), there was a significant positive correlation between ZBTB7C expression and immune cell infiltration, especially the infiltration of mast cells and B cells. In conclusion, ZBTB7C can be used as a potential therapeutic target across cancers and is related to immune cell infiltration."

Therefore, we explored the expression profiles of CENPU gene in breast carcinoma to better understand the functions of this gene, as well as the relationship between CENPU expression and the prognosis of breast carcinoma patients. Our results indicate that CENPU was expressed at significantly higher levels in cancerous tissues than in normal tissues. Furthermore, CENPU expression correlated significantly with many clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer. In addition, we discovered that high levels of CENPU expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Functional investigation revealed that 180 genes exhibited co-expression with CENPU. Functional annotation indicated that 17 of these genes were involved in the PLK1 signaling pathway, with most of them (16/17) being expressed at significantly higher levels in malignant tissues compared with normal controls and correlating with a poor prognosis. Subsequently, we found that four miRNAs, namely hsa-miR-543, hsa-miR-495-3p, hsa-miR-485-3p, and hsa-miR-337-3p, could be regarded as potential CENPU expression regulators. Then, five lncRNAs were predicted to potentially bind to the four miRNAs. Combination of the results from expression, survival, correlation analysis and functional experiments analysis demonstrated the link between lncRNA GATA3-AS1/miR-495-3p/CENPU axis and prognosis of breast cancer.

Ten-year adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is associated with 3.5% fewer recurrences compared to five years. The SOFT trial demonstrated small but statistically significant incremental improvements in long-term disease-free survival by the addition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog treatment (triptorelin) to an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane). Profound hypoestrogenism in the premenopausal age group may not be well tolerated due to a host of bothersome side effects (primarily vasomotor symptoms, musculoskeletal complaints, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and mood disorders). Prolonged hypoestrogenism in younger women is associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease, bone loss, cognitive decline, and all-cause mortality. This paper explores multi-system consequences of prolonged hypoestrogenism in premenopausal women derived from studies of women with and without breast cancer. Pretreatment counseling in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer should emphasize the benefit of prolonged estrogen suppression on breast cancer recurrence and established risks of lifelong hypoestrogenism on quality of life and all-cause mortality. Future genomic research may help identify the best candidates for extended ovarian suppression to avoid treating many women when only a minority benefit."

A growing number of studies have shown that dysregulated genes are associated with the occurrence and poor prognosis of a variety of tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 6 (C1QTNF6), a member of the C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family, has been revealed to play a role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Nevertheless, the effects and mechanisms of C1QTNF6 in NSCLC remain unrevealed. Materials and methods: MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide) and colony formation, flow cytometric and transwell assays were performed to explore the cell function. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression. Results: In the present study, we found that C1QTNF6 significantly promoted the proliferation of SPCA1 and A549 cells by MTT and colony formation assays. In addition, down-regulation of C1QTNF6 weakened the tumor growth in vivo. Besides, C1QTNF6 remarkably reduced apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis and TUNEL assay. Furthermore, the capability of migration and invasion was obviously enhanced on C1QTNF6 overexpression. Conclusion: Overall, our results demonstrated that inhibition of C1QTNF6 attenuated cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo of NSCLC. Based on the above results, our study provided us with a new and key perspective in understanding and treating NSCLC."

Since conventional kinase inhibitors can exhibit certain limitations to such kinase adaptations, overcoming kinase adaptation for cancer treatment gains importance. The cancer chaperone, Hsp90, is implicated in the conformational maturation and functional stabilization of mutated gene products. However, its role in kinase adaptations is not explored in detail. Therefore, the present study aims to understand the mechanisms of Hsp90-dependent kinase adaptation and develop a novel antitumor strategy. We chose malignant human lung cancer cells to demonstrate Hsp90-dependent RAF oncogene adaptation. We show that RAF oncogene adaptations were predominant over wild type RAF and are facilitated by conformation-specific Hsp90. Consequently, the conformation-specific Hsp90 inhibitor, 17AAG, interfered with oncogenic RAF stability and function and inhibited cell proliferation. The enforced cytostasis further triggered premature cellular senescence and acted as an efficient and irreversible tumor suppressor mechanism. Our results also display that oncogenic RAF interactions with Hsp90 require the middle-charged region of the chaperone. Our mice xenografts revealed that 17AAG pretreated tumor cells lost their ability to proliferate and metastasize in vivo. In summary, we demonstrated Hsp90-dependent kinase adaptation in tumor cells and the effect of Hsp90 inhibition in triggering premature senescence to interfere with the tumor progression. Our findings are of both biological relevance and clinical importance."

"Advanced breast cancer frequently metastasizes to the skeleton causing major mobility issues and hazards to quality of life. To manage osteolytic bone metastasis, bone-modifying agents and chemotherapy are recommended as the standard of care. Here, we investigated serologic biomarkers that might be associated with prognosis in breast cancer patients treated with zoledronic acid (ZA) and taxane-based chemotherapy. We collected serum samples from breast cancer patients with bone metastasis who received taxane plus ZA as palliative treatment. Fourteen biomarkers of angiogenesis, immunogenicity, and apoptosis were assessed, and the correlation between serum cytokine levels and patient?s prognosis was statistically analyzed. Sixty-six patients were enrolled, and samples from 40 patients were analyzed after laboratory quality control. Patients with low baseline PDGF-AA, high IFN-?, low MCP-2, low TGF-?1, and low TNF-? were significantly associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS). Decreasing VEGF and TNF-? and increasing FGF-2 and PDGF-AA in the early treatment phase indicated longer PFS. In univariate and multivariate analyses, low TGF-?1 and TNF-? and high IFN-? at baseline were associated with a significantly low hazard ratio for disease progression. Further, we designed a risk score with TGF-?1, TNF-?, and IFN-? levels, which could prognosticate patients for PFS. In conclusion, serum cytokine level, such as TGF-?1, TNF-?, and IFN-?, could be a potential prognostic biomarker for breast cancer patients with bone metastasis treated with ZA and taxane-based chemotherapy."

XP is mainly caused by mutations in XP-genes that are involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway that functions in the removal of bulky DNA adducts. Besides, the aggregation of DNA lesions is a life-threatening event that might be a key for developing various mutations facilitating cancer appearance. One of the key players of NER is XPC that senses helical distortions found in damaged DNA. The majority of XPC gene mutations are nonsense, and some are missense leading either to the loss of XPC protein or to the expression of a truncated nonfunctional version. Given that no cure is yet available, XPC patients should be completely protected and isolated from all types of UV radiations (UVR). Although it is still poorly understood, the characterization of the proteomic signature of an XPC mutant is essential to identify mediators that could be targeted to prevent cancer development in XPC patients. Unraveling this proteomic signature is fundamental to decipher the signaling pathways affected by the loss of XPC expression following exposure to UVB radiation. In this review, we will focus on the signaling pathways disrupted in skin cancer, pathways modulating NER's function, including XPC, to disclose signaling pathways associated with XPC loss and skin cancer occurrence."

However, the general regulatory mechanism of FoxM1 is still limited. STMN1 is a microtubule-binding protein which can inhibit the assembly of microtubule dimer or promote depolymerization of microtubules. It was reported as a major responsive factor of paclitaxel resistance for clinical chemotherapy of tumor patients. But the function of abnormally high level of STMN1 and its regulation mechanism in cancer cells remain unclear. In this study, we used public database and tissue microarrays to analyze the expression pattern of FoxM1 and STMN1 and found a strong positive correlation between FoxM1 and STMN1 in multiple types of cancer. Lentivirus-mediated FoxM1/STMN1-knockdown cell lines were established to study the function of FoxM1/STMN1 by performing cell viability assay, plate clone formation assay, soft agar assay in vitro and xenograft mouse model in vivo. Our results showed that FoxM1 promotes cell proliferation by upregulating STMN1. Further ChIP assay showed that FoxM1 upregulates STMN1 in a transcriptional level. Prognostic analysis showed that a high level of FoxM1 and STMN1 is related to poor prognosis in solid tumors. Moreover, a high co-expression of FoxM1 and STMN1 has a more significant correlation with poor prognosis. Our findings suggest that a general FoxM1-STMN1 axis contributes to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. The combination of FoxM1 and STMN1 can be a more precise biomarker for prognostic prediction."

Now, no targeted therapies are available for patients with BLBC due to the lack of reliable and effective molecular targets. Here, we performed the BLBC tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical analysis and showed that Faciogenital Dysplasia 5 (FGD5) abundance is associated with poor prognosis in BLBCs. FGD5 deletion decreased the proliferation, invasion, and tumorsphere formation capacity of BLBC cells. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Fgd5 in mouse mammary epithelial cells attenuated BLBC initiation and progression by reducing the self-renewal ability of tumor-initiating cells. In addition, FGD5 abundance was positively correlated with the abundance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in BLBCs. FGD5 ablation decreased EGFR abundance by reducing EGFR stability in TNBC cells in 2D and 3D culture conditions. Mechanistically, FGD5 binds to EGFR and interferes with basal EGFR ubiquitination and degradation induced by the E3 ligase ITCH. Impaired EGFR degradation caused BLBC cell proliferation and promoted invasive properties and self-renewal. To verify the role of the FGD5-EGFR interaction in the regulation of EGFR stability, we screened a cell-penetrating.-helical peptide PER3 binding with FGD5 to disrupt the interaction. Treatment of BLBC patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice with the peptide PER3 disrupting the FGD5-EGFR interaction either with or without chemotherapy reduced BLBC progression. Our study identified FGD5 as a positive modulator of tumor-initiating cells and suggests a potential therapeutic option for the BLBC subtype of breast cancer."

Numerous studies have proven that effective stratification of cancer patients would promote the personalized application of immunotherapy. Therefore, we used the transcriptome data of nearly 1,000 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to construct a new immune subgroup. We found that the new immune subgroup, named cluster 2, was a mixture of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and showed poor overall survival, which was further verified in the independent validation set. Immune infiltration correlation analysis showed that the Mast cell type and its status subdivisions had a predictive effect on the prognosis of NSCLC, especially in LUAD. Phenotypic analysis suggested that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was positively correlated with immunosuppression, supporting the correlation between tumor phenotype and immune background. Although immune subtypes failed to significantly distinguish the progression-free survival (PFS) of immunotherapy patients, they showed the expected trend; the sample size needs to be further expanded for verification. In addition, some results indicated that the two cancer types, LUAD and LUSC, might require independent analyses."

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), responsible for tumor recurrence are often found in the nutrient limiting cores. Our study uncovers the molecular basis and cellular links between glutamine deprivation and stemness in the cancer cells. We showed that glutamine is dispensable for the survival of ovarian and colon cancer cells while it is required for their proliferation. Glutamine starvation leads to the metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells with enhanced glycolysis and unaltered oxidative phosphorylation. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glutamine limiting condition induces MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway to phosphorylate dynamin-related protein-1(DRP1) at Ser616. Moreover, p-DRP1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and enhances numbers of CD44 and CD117/CD45 positive CSCs. Besides the established features of cancer stem cells, glutamine deprivation induces perinuclear localization of fragmented mitochondria and reduction in proliferation rate which are usually observed in CSCs. Treatment with glutaminase inhibitor (L-DON) mimics the effects of glutamine starvation without altering cell survival in in vitro as well as in in vivo model. Interestingly, the combinatorial treatment of L-DON with DRP1 inhibitor (MDiVi-1) reduces the stem cell population in tumor tissue in mouse model. Collectively our data suggest that glutamine deficiency in the core of tumors can increase the cancer stem cell population and the combination therapy with MDiVi-1 and L-DON is a useful approach to reduce CSCs population in tumor."

However, the sources of cellular and mitochondrial redox stresses and the mutual interacting effects between these redox stresses and apoptosis remain unclear. To address this issue, we examined a panel of reactive species and used the inhibitors of cellular reactive species (N-acetylcysteine (NAC)), mitochondrial reactive species (MitoTEMPO), and apoptosis (Z-VAD-FMK; ZVAD) to explore their interactions in manoalide-treated oral cancer Ca9-22 and CAL 27 cells. Hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 center dot), nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot), carbonate radical-anion (CO3 center dot), peroxynitrite (ONOO), and superoxide (O-2(center dot)) were increased in oral cancer cells following manoalide treatments in terms of fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Cellular reactive species (?OH, NO2 center dot, (NO)-N-center dot, CO3 center dot, and ONOO) as well as cellular and mitochondrial reactive species (O-2(center dot)) were induced in oral cancer cells following manoalide treatment for 6 h. NAC, MitoTEMPO, and ZVAD inhibit manoalide-induced apoptosis in terms of annexin V and pancaspase activity assays. Moreover, NAC inhibits mitochondrial reactive species and MitoTEMPO inhibits cellular reactive species, suggesting that cellular and mitochondrial reactive species can crosstalk to regulate each other. ZVAD shows suppressing effects on the generation of both cellular and mitochondrial reactive species. In conclusion, manoalide induces reciprocally activation between cellular and mitochondrial reactive species and apoptosis in oral cancer cells."

"Unraveling the Molecular Nexus between GPCRs, ERS, and EMT"	MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION			English	Review								"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a large family of transmembrane proteins that transduce an external stimulus into a variety of cellular responses. They play a critical role in various pathological conditions in humans, including cancer, by regulating a number of key processes involved in tumor formation and progression. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process in promoting cancer cell invasion and tumor dissemination leading to metastasis, an often intractable state of the disease. Uncontrolled proliferation and persistent metabolism of cancer cells also induce oxidative stress, hypoxia, and depletion of growth factors and nutrients. These disturbances lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induce a cellular condition called ER stress (ERS) which is counteracted by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Many GPCRs modulate ERS and UPR signaling via ERS sensors, IRE1 alpha, PERK, and ATF6, to support cancer cell survival and inhibit cell death. By regulating downstream signaling pathways such as NF-kappa B, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, TGF-beta, and Wnt/beta-catenin, GPCRs also upregulate mesenchymal transcription factors including Snail, ZEB, and Twist superfamilies which regulate cell polarity, cytoskeleton remodeling, migration, and invasion. Likewise, ERS-induced UPR upregulates gene transcription and expression of proteins related to EMT enhancing tumor aggressiveness. Though GPCRs are attractive therapeutic targets in cancer biology, much less is known about their roles in regulating ERS and EMT. Here, we will discuss the interplay in GPCR-ERS linked to the EMT process of cancer cells, with a particular focus on oncogenes and molecular signaling pathways."

The capacity for protein synthesis is mainly determined by the abundance of muscle ribosomes, which is in turn regulated by transcription of the ribosomal (r)RNA genes (rDNA). In this study, we investigated whether muscle loss in a preclinical model of ovarian cancer is associated with a reduction in ribosomal capacity and was a consequence of impaired rDNA transcription. Tumor bearing resulted in a significant loss in gastrocnemius muscle weight and protein synthesis capacity, and was consistent with a significant reduction in rDNA transcription and ribosomal capacity. Despite the induction of the ribophagy receptor NUFIP1 mRNA and the loss of NUFIP1 protein, in vitro studies revealed that while inhibition of autophagy rescued NUFIP1, it did not prevent the loss of rRNA. Electrophoretic analysis of rRNA fragmentation from both in vivo and in vitro models showed no evidence of endonucleolytic cleavage, suggesting that rRNA degradation may not play a major role in modulating muscle ribosome abundance. Our results indicate that in this model of ovarian cancer-induced cachexia, the ability of skeletal muscle to synthesize protein is compromised by a reduction in rDNA transcription and consequently a lower ribosomal capacity. Thus, impaired ribosomal production appears to play a key role in the anabolic deficits associated with muscle wasting in cancer cachexia."

Most Jumonji C domain-containing (JMJD) proteins are histone lysine demethylases (KDM) and therefore epigenetic regulators. One JMJD subfamily consists of JMJDLA/KDM3A, JMJD1B/KDM3B, and JMJD1C/KDM3C that are roughly 50% identical at the amino acid level. All three JMJD1 proteins are capable of removing dimethyl and monomethyl marks from lysine 9 on histone H3 and might also demethylate histone H4 on arginine 3 and nonhistone proteins. Analysis of knockout mice revealed critical roles for JMJD1 proteins in fertility, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease. Importantly, a plethora of studies demonstrated that especially JMJD1A and JMJD1C are overexpressed in various tumors, stimulate cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and facilitate efficient tumor growth. However, JMJD1A may also inhibit the formation of germ cell tumors. Likewise, JMJD1B appears to be a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia, but a tumor promoter in other cancers. Notably, by reducing methylation levels on histone H3 lysine 9, JMJD1 proteins can profoundly alter the transcriptome and thereby affect tumorigenesis, including through upregulating oncogenes such as CCND1, JUN, and MYC. This epigenetic activity of JMJD1 proteins is sensitive to heavy metals, oncometabolites, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species, whose levels are frequently altered within cancer cells. In conclusion, inhibition of JMJD1 enzymatic activity through small molecules is predicted to be beneficial in many different cancers, but not in the few malignancies where JMJD1 proteins apparently exert tumor-suppressive functions."

However, the mechanisms underlying DKK1 expression are poorly understood. RNA sequence analysis revealed that expression of the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and its target genes concordantly fluctuated with expression of DKK1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. DKK1 knockdown decreased FOXM1 expression and vice versa in PDAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. Inhibition of either the DKK1-CKAP4-AKT pathway or the ERK pathway suppressed FOXM1 expression, and simultaneous inhibition of both pathways showed synergistic effects. A FOXM1 binding site was identified in the 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-untranslated region of the DKK1 gene, and its depletion decreased DKK1 expression and cancer cell proliferation. Clinicopathological and database analysis revealed that PDAC and ESCC patients who simultaneously express DKK1 and FOXM1 have a poorer prognosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that expression of both DKK1 and FOXM1 is the independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients.

Thus, it is not surprising that mutations of p53 are the most common genetic alterations found in human cancer. Emerging evidence indicates that dysregulation of lipid metabolism by p53 can have a profound impact not only on cancer cells but also cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In particular, intermediates of the sphingolipid and lysophospholipid pathways regulate many cellular responses common to p53 such as cell survival, migration, DNA damage repair and apoptosis. The majority of these cellular events become dysregulated in cancer as well as cell senescence. In this review, we will provide an account on the seminal contributions of Prof. Lina Obeid, who deciphered the crosstalk between p53 and the sphingolipid pathway particularly in modulating DNA damage repair and apoptosis in non-transformed as well as transformed cells. We will also provide insights on the integrative role of p53 with the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling pathway in cancer progression and TME regulation."

However, in cancer cells the half-lives of miRNAs are comparatively short. To understand the mechanism of rapid miRNA turnover in cancer cells, we explored the effect of target mRNAs on the abundance of the miRNAs that repress them. We have noted an accelerated extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated export of miRNAs in presence of their target mRNAs in mammalian cells, and this target-driven miRNA-export process is retarded by Ago2-interacting protein GW182B. The GW182 group of proteins are localized to GW182 bodies or RNA processing bodies in mammalian cells, and GW182B-dependent retardation of miRNA export depends on GW body integrity and is independent of the HuR protein-mediated auxiliary pathway of miRNA export. Our data thus support the existence of a HuR-independent pathway of miRNA export in human cells that can be targeted in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, to increase the level of cellular let-7a, a known negative regulator of cancer growth."

Herein, we analyzed the effect of the 9-mer dimer defensin-like peptide, CopA3, against colorectal cancer cell growth and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner upon 96 h of treatment. As observed, CopA3 treatment significantly affected cancer cell growth, reduced colony formation ability, increased the number of SA-beta-Gal positive cells, and remarkably reduced Ki67 protein expression. Notably, in HCT-116 cells, CopA3 (5 mu M) treatment effectively increased oxidative stress and, as a result, amplified the endogenous ROS, mitochondrial ROS, and NO content in the cells, which further activated the DNA damage response and caused cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The prolonged cell-cycle arrest elevated the release of inflammatory cytokines in the cell supernatant. Nevertheless, mechanistically, NAC treatment effectively reversed the CopA3 effect and significantly reduced the oxidative stress; subsequently rescuing the cells from G1 phase arrest. Overall, CopA3 treatment can inhibit the growth and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest through the ROS-mediated pathway."

The oncogenic cascade involves genetic, epigenetic, signalling pathways, intracellular trafficking and/or metabolic alterations within cancer cells. In addition, pre-malignant and malignant cells orchestrate complex and dynamic interactions with non-malignant cells and acellular matricial components or secreted factors within the tumour microenvironment that is instrumental in the progression of the disease. As our aptitude to effectively treat cancer mostly depends on our ability to decipher, properly diagnose and impede cancer progression and metastasis formation, full characterisation of molecular complexes and cellular processes at play along the metastasis cascade is crucial. For many years, the scientific community lacked adapted imaging and molecular technologies to accurately dissect, at the highest resolution possible, tumour and stromal cells behaviour within their natural microenvironment. In that context, the NANOTUMOR consortium is a French national multi-disciplinary workforce which aims at a providing a multi-scale characterisation of the oncogenic cascade, from the atomic level to the dynamic organisation of the cell in response to genetic mutations, environmental changes or epigenetic modifications. Ultimately, this program aims at identifying new therapeutic targets using innovative drug design."

The barrier is formed by tightly linked intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (i.e. enterocytes, goblet cells, neuroendocrine cells, tuft cells, Paneth cells, and M cells), which constantly self-renew and shed. IECs also communicate with microbiota, coordinate innate and adaptive effector cell functions. In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways contributing to intestinal cell fates and homeostasis functions. We focus especially on intestinal stem cell proliferation, cell junction formation, remodelling, hypoxia, the impact of intestinal microbiota, the immune system, inflammation, and metabolism. Recognizing the critical role of KRAS mutants in colorectal cancer, we highlight the connections of KRAS signaling pathways in coordinating these functions. Furthermore, we review the impact of KRAS colorectal cancer mutants on pathway rewiring associated with disruption and dysfunction of the normal intestinal homeostasis. Given that KRAS is still considered undruggable and the development of treatments that directly target KRAS are unlikely, we discuss the suitability of targeting pathways downstream of KRAS as well as alterations of cell extrinsic/microenvironmental factors as possible targets for modulating signaling pathways in colorectal cancer."

We examined the role of Hpa2 in pancreatic cancer, a malignancy characterized by a dense fibrotic ECM associated with poor response to treatment and bad prognosis. We show that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients that exhibit high levels of Hpa2 survive longer than patients with low levels of Hpa2. Strikingly, overexpression of Hpa2 in pancreatic carcinoma cells resulted in a most prominent decrease in the growth of tumors implanted orthotopically and intraperitoneally, whereas Hpa2 silencing resulted in bigger tumors. We further found that Hpa2 enhances endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and renders cells more sensitive to external stress, associating with increased apoptosis. Interestingly, we observed that ER stress induces the expression of Hpa2, thus establishing a feedback loop by which Hpa2 enhances ER stress that, in turn, induces Hpa2 expression. This leads to increased apoptosis and attenuated tumor growth. Altogether, Hpa2 emerges as a powerful tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, the underlying mechanisms of M2 macrophage that modulate the progression of gastric cancer (GC) remain largely unknown. In this study, we detected the ratio of macrophages in GC tissues and found that the proportion of M2 macrophages was increased in GC tissues. We then co-cultured GC cells with M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively, and then assessed cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of GC cells by MTT and colony formation assay. The results indicated that M2 macrophages promoted the proliferation of GC cells, but M1 not. Besides, GW4869, an exosomes inhibitor, reduced the effects induced by M2 macrophage. Then, we isolated and identified exosomes derived from M1 and M2 macrophage, and confirmed that the exosomes could be taken up by GC cells. We demonstrated that M2 macrophage-exosomes could induce the proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.

In conclusion, exosomal miR-487a derived from M2 macrophage promotes the proliferation and tumorigenesis in gastric cancer, and the novel findings might be helpful to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods in GC."

It is now evident that cell adhesion-mediated resistance (CAM-DR) limits the success of cancer therapies and is a great obstacle to overcome in the clinic. The interactions between tumor cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules or adjacent cells may play a significant role in initiating the intracellular signaling pathways that are associated with cell proliferation, survival upon binding to their ligands. Recent studies illustrate that these adhesion-related factors may contribute to the survival of cancer cells after chemotherapeutic therapy, advantageous to resistant cells to proliferate and develop multiple mechanisms of drug resistance. In this review, we focus on the molecular basis of these interactions and the main signal transduction pathways that are involved in the enhancement of the cancer cells' survival. Furthermore, therapies targeting interactions between cancer cells and their environment to enhance drug response or prevent the emergence of drug resistance will also be discussed."

Covalently bound octahedral DNA nanocages were functionalized with folate molecules and utilized as scaffolds to engineer four sequestering units with a miR-21 complementary sequence for obtaining biocompatible Fol-miR21-NC non-toxic nanostructures, to be able to selectively recognize folate receptor alpha-overexpressing cancer cells and sequester the oncogenic miR-21. qPCR assays showed that Fol-miR21-NCs reduce the miR-21 expression up to 80% in cancer cells in the first 2 days of treatment. Functional assays demonstrated that miR-21 sequestering leads to up-regulation of miR-21 tumor suppressor targets (i.e., PTEN and Pdcd4), reduction in cancer cell migration, reduction in proliferation, and increase in cell death.

CSCs expressed more SCD1 than bulk cultured cells (BCCs), and blocking SCD1 expression or function revealed an essential role for SCD1 in the survival of CSCs, but not BCCs. The CSC potential selectively decreased after treatment with the SCD1 inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. The CSC-selective suppression was mediated through the induction of apoptosis. The mechanism leading to selective CSC death was investigated by performing a quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 14 CSC-specific signaling and marker genes after 24 and 48 h of treatment with two concentrations of an inhibitor. The decrease in the expression of Notch1 and AXIN2 preceded changes in the expression of all other genes, at 24 h of treatment in a dose-dependent manner, followed by the downregulation of most Wnt- and NOTCH-signaling genes.

In this study, we firstly found that SHC1 expression was up-regulated both in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissues. Furthermore, compared to patients with lower SHC1 expression, LUAD patients with higher expression of SHC1 had poorer overall survival (OS). Moreover, higher expression of SHC1 was also associated with worse OS in patients with stages 1 and 2 but not stage 3 lung cancer. Significantly, the analysis showed that SHC1 methylation level was associated with OS in lung cancer patients. It seemed that the methylation level at specific probes within SHC1 showed negative correlations with SHC1 expression both in LUAD and in LUSC tissues.

We investigated the expression and importance of GABARAP in breast cancer. We analyzed the expression of GABARAP and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis (TCGA). To explain the role and potential mechanism of GABARAP in regulating tumor development, we performed acquisition and loss of function experiments using cell lines and models of mouse xenotransplantation. We found that GABARAP inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Notably, low levels of GABARAP induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Low levels of GABARAP increased p-AKT and pmTOR levels, and a specific AKT pathway inhibitor reversed the downregulation of GABARAP-induced tumor progression. GABARAP negatively correlated with advanced clinicopathological features in clinical specimens, such as tumor size and TNM stage. Notably, patients with low GABARAP levels had a poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that GABARAP expression negatively correlated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP14. Conclusively, these data indicate that GABARAP suppresses the malignant behaviors of breast cancer likely via the AKT/mTOR pathway.

Basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3) is an oncogene and hazardous prognosticator in CRC. Although two distinct functional mechanisms of BTF3 in different cancer types have been reported, its role in CRC is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to molecularly characterize the oncogene BTF3 and its targets in CRC. Here, we first identified the transcriptional targets of BTF3 by applying combined RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis, identifying CHD1L as a transcriptional target of BTF3. Thereafter, we conducted immunoprecipitation (IP)-MS and E3 ubiquitin ligase analysis to identify potential interacting targets of BTF3 as a subunit of the nascent-polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). The analysis revealed that BTF3 might also inhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2-mediated p53 degradation. Finally, miRNAs targeting BTF3 were predicted and validated. Decreased miR-497-5p expression is responsible for higher levels of BTF3 post-transcriptionally. Collectively, we concluded that BTF3 is an oncogene, and there may exist a transcription factor and NAC-related proteolysis mechanism in CRC.

Within the tumor stroma, O-2 and nutrients are abnormally distributed between various cells (preferentially for supplying cancer cells), the immune contexture is abnormally positioned (permissive essentially for cells exhibiting tumor-promoting capacity), the fibroblast and fibrotic content is abnormally distributed (presence of both extracellular matrix [ECM] stiffening and ECM-degrading factors both for tumor-promoting purposes), and the tumor vasculature is abnormally orchestrated (for hindering drug delivery and increasing the chance of tumor metastasis). Resistance is actually an adaptive response to an imbalance in the tumor ecosystem; thus, the key consideration for effective cancer therapy is to bring back the normal status in this ecosystem so as to reach the desired durable outcome. Vascular normalization, metabolic modulation (glucose delivery in particular), balancing cellular dispersion, and balancing the pH rate and O-2 delivery within the tumor microenvironment are suggested strategies to reverse abnormality within the tumor stroma."

Whereas NKT have well-established roles in mitigating a number of human diseases, herein, we focus on their role in cancer. NKT cells have been shown to directly and indirectly mediate anti-tumor immunity and manipulating their effector functions can have therapeutic significances in treatment of cancer. In this review, we highlight several therapeutic strategies that have been used to harness the effector functions of NKT cells to target different types of solid tumors. We also discuss several barriers to the successful utilization of NKT cells and summarize effective strategies being developed to harness the unique strengths of this potent population of T cells. Collectively, studies investigating the therapeutic potential of NKT cells serve not only to advance our understanding of this powerful immune cell subset, but also pave the way for future treatments focused on the modulation of NKT cell responses to enhance cancer immunotherapy."

Core 1 beta 1, 3-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1), an enzyme highly expressed in various cancers, is correlated with tumor initiation and development. However, the role of C1GALT1 in lung cancer remains poorly understood. In this study, through bioinformatic analysis and clinical validation, we first discovered that C1GALT1 expression was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues and was closely related to poor prognosis in patients with LUAD. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that C1GALT1 promoted LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor formation in vivo. Further investigation demonstrated that RAC1 expression was positively regulated by C1GALT1 in LUAD, whereas silencing Rac1 could reverse C1GALT1-induced tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, miR-181d-5p was identified as a negative regulator for C1GALT1 in LUAD. As expected, the inhibitory effects of miR-181d-5p on LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were counteracted by restoration of C1GALT1. In summary, our results highlight the importance of the miR-181d-5p/C1GALT1/RAC1 regulatory axis during LUAD progression. Thus, C1GALT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for LUAD."

With the gene expression data of oesophageal cancer in a public database, we used CIBERSORT to estimate the fractions of 22 infiltrating immune cell types. We then built an immunoscore signature based on 12 types of infiltrating immune cells using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model. This immunoscore was used as an independent predictor in the prognostic model (training cohort: [hazard ratio (HR), 4.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.64-8.67; P < 0.001], validation cohort: [HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.04-4.45; P = 0.040]). Subgroup analysis by clinical features showed that overall survival was significantly different between the high-immunoscore group and the low-immunoscore group. The predictors that constituted the individualized prediction nomogram were immunoscore, age, and tumour stage. The nomogram had good discrimination and calibration. Decision curve analysis showed that the immunoscore nomogram was clinically useful. Therefore, the novel immunoscore signature based on infiltrating immune cells can be used as a reliable predictor of the prognosis of oesophageal cancer, and the immunoscore nomogram is a convenient tool for predicting the survival of individual patients."

However, the mechanisms underlying the role of BTF3 as an oncogenic transcription factor in prostate tumorigenesis have not been explored. Herein, we report that BTF3 confers oncogenic activity in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, while both BTF3 splicing isoforms (BTF3a and BTF3b) promote cell growth, BTF3b, but not BTF3a, regulates the transcriptional expression of the genes encoding the subunits of Replication Factor C (RFC) family that is involved in DNA replication and damage repair processes. BTF3 knockdown results in decreased expression of RFC genes, and consequently attenuated DNA replication, deficient DNA damage repair, and increased G2/M arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of the RFC3 subunit diminishes the growth advantage and DNA damage repair capability conferred by ectopic overexpression of BTF3b. Importantly, we show that enforced BTF3 overexpression in prostate cancer cells induces substantial accumulation of cisplatin-DNA adducts and render the cells more sensitive to cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide novel insights into the role of BTF3 as an oncogenic transcription factor in prostate cancer and suggest that BTF3 expression levels may serve as a potential biomarker to predict cisplatin treatment response."

Previous studies have revealed that hTERT can reduce cancer cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and accelerate cancer progression; however, the mechanism remains poorly understood. NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a molecule that plays a significant role in regulating cellular ROS homeostasis, but whether there is a correlation between hTERT and NRF2 remains unclear. Here, we showed that hTERT increases CRC proliferation and migration by inducing NRF2 upregulation. We further found that hTERT increases NRF2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Our data also revealed that hTERT primarily upregulates NRF2 by increasing NRF2 promoter activity rather than by regulating NRF2 mRNA or protein stability. Using DNA pull-down/MS analysis, we found that hTERT can recruit YBX1 to upregulate NRF2 promoter activity. We also found that hTERT/YBX1 may localize to the P2 region of the NRF2 promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hTERT facilitates CRC proliferation and migration by upregulating NRF2 expression through the recruitment of the transcription factor YBX1 to activate the NRF2 promoter.

CCM3 is a gatekeeper in focal adhesions regulating mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ signalling	NATURE CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FIBROBLASTS; MATRIX; AUTOPHOSPHORYLATION; RECOGNITION; GENERATION; INVASION; LEUCINE; COMPLEX; GROWTH; TAZ	"Wang et al. identify CCM3 as a negative regulator of YAP/TAZ activation and mechanotransduction in focal adhesions, with important roles in controlling mesenchymal/stromal stem cell differentiation and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer. The YAP/TAZ transcriptional programme is not only a well-established driver of cancer progression and metastasis but also an important stimulator of tissue regeneration. Here we identified Cerebral cavernous malformations 3 (CCM3) as a regulator of mechanical cue-driven YAP/TAZ signalling, controlling both tumour progression and stem cell differentiation. We demonstrate that CCM3 localizes to focal adhesion sites in cancer-associated fibroblasts, where it regulates mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ activation. Mechanistically, CCM3 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mutually compete for binding to paxillin to fine-tune FAK/Src/paxillin-driven mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ activation. In mouse models of breast cancer, specific loss of CCM3 in cancer-associated fibroblasts leads to exacerbated tissue remodelling and force transmission to the matrix, resulting in reciprocal YAP/TAZ activation in the neighbouring tumour cells and dissemination of metastasis to distant organs. Similarly, CCM3 regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. In conclusion, CCM3 is a gatekeeper in focal adhesions that controls mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ signalling."

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is also an oncogene implicated in various carcinomas, including breast cancer. In this study, we found that PRMT5 interacts with KLF5 and catalyzes the di-methylation of KLF5 at Arginine 57 (R57) in a methyltransferase activity-dependent manner in BLBC cells. Depletion or pharmaceutical inhibition (using PJ-68) of PRMT5 decreased the expression of KLF5 and its downstream target genes in vitro and in vivo. PRMT5-induced KLF5R57me2 antagonizes GSK3 beta-mediated KLF5 phosphorylation and subsequently Fbw7-mediated KLF5 ubiquitination and coupled degradation. Functionally, PRMT5 promotes breast cancer stem cell maintenance and proliferation, at least partially, by stabilizing KLF5. PRMT5 and KLF5 protein levels were positively correlated in clinical BLBCs. Taken together, PRMT5 methylates KLF5 to prevent its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, and thus promotes breast cancer stem cell maintenance and proliferation. These findings suggest that PRMT5 is a potential therapeutic target for BLBC."

Previous studies have reported that miR-4429 develops anticancer function in follicular thyroid carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, whether miR-4429 is implicated in the CRC progression remains to be clarified. The aim of our current study was to explore the potential role of miR-4429 in CRC. According to the result of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, miR-4429 was expressed at a low level in CRC cells. Gain-of-function assays showed that the upregulation of miR-4429 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in CRC, whereas miR-4429 inhibition led to the opposite results. It was uncovered from mechanism experiments that miR-4429 targeted forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and therefore regulating SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) expression. Rescue experiments elucidated that miR-4429 influenced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT process in CRC by targeting FOXM1 to inactivate SMAD3. In conclusion, our study revealed that miR-4429 targeted FOXM1 to decrease SMAD3 expression and thus impeding cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT process of CRC cells."

This tumour is characterized by IGF-II (insulin-like growth factor II) overproduction, aromatase and ER alpha (oestrogen receptor alpha) up-regulation. Previous reports suggest that ER alpha expression can be regulated by sirt1 (sirtuin 1), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent class III histone deacetylases that modulates activity of several substrates involved in cellular stress, metabolism, proliferation, senescence, protein degradation and apoptosis. Nevertheless, sirt1 can act as a tumour suppressor or oncogenic protein. In this study, we found that in H295R and SW13 cell lines, sirt1 expression is inhibited by sirtinol, a potent inhibitor of sirt1 activity. In addition, sirtinol is able to decrease ACC cell proliferation, colony and spheroids formation and to activate the intrinsic apoptotic mechanism. Particularly, we observed that sirtinol interferes with E2/ER alpha and IGF1R (insulin growth factor 1 receptor) pathways by decreasing receptors expression. Sirt1 involvement was confirmed by using a specific sirt1 siRNA. More importantly, we observed that sirtinol can synergize with mitotane, a selective adrenolitic drug, in inhibiting adrenocortical cancer cell growth. Collectively, our data reveal an oncogenic role for sirt1 in ACC and its targeting could implement treatment options for this type of cancer."

However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we identified a hypoxia-induced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) KB-1980E6.3, which is aberrantly upregulated in clinical breast cancer tissues and closely correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. The enhanced lncRNA KB-1980E6.3 facilitates breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) self-renewal and tumorigenesis under hypoxic microenvironment both in vitro and in vivo.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the mechanism of FXR in cervical cancer. Western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that FXR was significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma tissues, although there were no associations of metastasis and TNM stage with FXR. In Lenti-FXR cells obtained by lentiviral transfection, the overexpression of FXR reduced cell viability and colony formation. Compared with the Lenti-Vector groups, the overexpression of FXR induced early and late apoptosis and promoted G1 arrest. With time, early apoptosis decreased, and late apoptosis increased. In tumor xenograft experiments, overexpression of FXR upregulated small heterodimer partner (SHP), murine double minute-2 (MDM2), and p53 in the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) showed that SHP directly interacted with MDM2, which is important to protect p53 from ubiquitination. Nutlin3a increased MDM2 and p53 amounts in the Lenti-Vector groups, without effects in the Lenti-FXR groups.

In this research, LSCC expression data, which quantify the cellular composition of immune cells, were analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and a deconvolution algorithm based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the results indicated a close relationship between LSCC and CD8(+) T cells. Six hub genes (SYT3, METTL8, HSPB3, GFM1, ERLIN2, and CLCN2) were verified by gene-gene network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. We found that the six hub genes were increased in cancer tissues and were closely correlated with cancer development and progression. After immune correlation analysis, METTL8 was selected as a prognostic biomarker. Finally, we found that the METTL8 levels were increased in multiple lung cancer cell lines and LSCC tissues. METTL8 inhibition could clearly induce G1 cell cycle arrest and suppress proliferation.

Elucidating the mechanisms between these two pathologies is essential to identify the potential therapeutic molecular targets for colorectal cancer (CRC). 716 colorectal patients from the First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were involved in our study and metabolic disorders were proven to increase the risk of CRC. The prognostic value of the MetS factors was analyzed using the Cox regression model and a clinical MetS-based nomogram was established. Then by using multi-omics techniques, the distinct molecular mechanism of MetS genes in CRC was firstly systematically characterized. Strikingly, MetS genes were found to be highly correlated with the effectiveness of targeted chemotherapy administration, especially for mTOR and VEGFR pathways. Our results further demonstrated that overexpression of MetS core gene IL6 would promote the malignancy of CRC, which was highly dependent on mTOR-S6K signaling. In conclusion, we comprehensively explored the clinical value and molecular mechanism of MetS in the progression of CRC, which may serve as a candidate option for cancer management and therapy in the future."

Using bioinformatics analyses, we ascertained that CD36 expression was increased in metastatic GC specimens in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, higher CD36 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05) and poor prognosis (p = 0.030) in 79 Chinese GC patients. Basal CD36 expression levels correlated positively with migration, invasion, and expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in GC cell lines, a relationship confirmed by knockdown and overexpression experiments. Importantly, analysis of gene expression changes in CD36-knockdown GC cells led us to identify the chromatin-associated protein DEK as a c-Myc target that mediates activation of the GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway to trigger EMT.

However, the epigenetically regulated lncRNAs and their association with clinical outcome and therapeutic response in ovarian cancer (OV) remain poorly investigated. This study performed an integrative analysis of DNA methylation data and transcriptome data and identified 419 lncRNAs as potential epigenetically regulated lncRNAs. Using machine-learning and multivariate Cox regression analysis methods, we identified and developed an epigenetically regulated lncRNA expression signature (EpiLncRNASig) consisting of five lncRNAs from the list of 17 epigenetically regulated lncRNAs significantly associated with outcome. The EpiLncRNASig could stratify patients into high-risk groups and low-risk groups with significantly different survival and chemotherapy response in different patient cohorts. Multivariate Cox regression analyses, after adjusted by other clinical features and treatment response, demonstrated the independence of the DEpiLncSig in predicting survival. Functional analysis for relevant protein-coding genes of the DEpiLncSig indicated enrichment of known immune-related or cancer-related biological pathways. Taken together, our study not only provides a promising prognostic biomarker for predicting outcome and chemotherapy response but also will improve our understanding of lncRNA epigenetic regulation mechanisms in OV."

Targeting transcription of MCL-1 sensitizes HER2-amplified breast cancers to HER2 inhibitors	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article								"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene (HER2) is focally amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers. HER2 inhibitors alone are not effective, and sensitizing agents will be necessary to move away from a reliance on heavily toxic chemotherapeutics. We recently demonstrated that the efficacy of HER2 inhibitors is mitigated by uniformly low levels of the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) endogenous inhibitor, NOXA. Emerging clinical data have demonstrated that clinically advanced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors are effective MCL-1 inhibitors in patients, and, importantly, well tolerated. We, therefore, tested whether the CDK inhibitor, dinaciclib, could block MCL-1 in preclinical HER2-amplified breast cancer models and therefore sensitize these cancers to dual HER2/EGFR inhibitors neratinib and lapatinib, as well as to the novel selective HER2 inhibitor tucatinib. Indeed, we found dinaciclib suppresses MCL-1 RNA and is highly effective at sensitizing HER2 inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. This combination was tolerable in vivo. Mechanistically, liberating the effector BCL-2 protein, BAK, from MCL-1 results in robust apoptosis. Thus, clinically advanced CDK inhibitors may effectively combine with HER2 inhibitors and present a chemotherapy-free therapeutic strategy in HER2-amplified breast cancer, which can be tested immediately in the clinic."

Chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy induce intracellular stress response pathways in tumor cells, leading to a secretion of various factors belonging to a family of damage-associated molecular patterns molecules, capable of inducing the adaptive immune response. One of them is calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum-associated chaperone. Its presence on the surface of dying tumor cells serves as an eat me signal for antigen presenting cells (APC). Engulfment of tumor cells by APCs results in the presentation of tumor's antigens to cytotoxic T-cells and production of cytokines/chemokines, which activate immune cells responsible for tumor cells killing. Thus, the development of ICD and the expression of CRT can help standard therapy to eradicate tumor cells. Here, we review the physiological functions of CRT and its involvement in the ICD appearance in malignant disease. Moreover, we also focus on the ability of various anti-cancer drugs to induce expression of surface CRT on ovarian cancer cells. The second aim of this work is to discuss and summarize the prognostic/predictive value of CRT in ovarian cancer patients."

However, the mechanisms governing OXPHOS to facilitate tumor metastasis remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that arginine 21(R21) and lysine 108 (K108) of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 (MRPS23) was methylated by the protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) and SET-domain-containing protein 6 (SETD6), respectively. R21 methylation accelerated the poly-ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MRPS23 to a low level. The MRPS23 degradation inhibited OXPHOS with elevated mtROS level, which consequently increased breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In contrast, K108 methylation increased MRPS23 stability, and K108 methylation coordinated with R21 methylation to maintain a low level of MRPS23, which was in favor of supporting breast cancer cell survival through regulating OXPHOS. Consistently, R21 and K108 methylation was correlated with malignant breast carcinoma. Significantly, our findings unveil a unique mechanism of controlling OXPHOS by arginine and lysine methylation and point to the impact of the PRMT7-SETD6-MRPS23 axis during breast cancer metastasis."

However, until now autophagy-inhibiting monotherapies have not demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity. We now show that autophagy blockade prompts established PDAC to upregulate and utilize an alternative nutrient procurement pathway: macropinocytosis (MP) that allows tumor cells to extract nutrients from extracellular sources and use them for energy generation. The autophagy to MP switch, which may be evolutionarily conserved and not cancer cell restricted, depends on activation of transcription factor NRF2 by the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1. NRF2 activation by oncogenic mutations, hypoxia, and oxidative stress also results in MP upregulation. Inhibition of MP in autophagy-compromised PDAC elicits dramatic metabolic decline and regression of transplanted and autochthonous tumors, suggesting the therapeutic promise of combining autophagy and MP inhibitors in the clinic."

Regulatory non-coding variants can be inspected and analyzed along with coding variants, and their functional impact further explored by examining 3D genome data from cancer cell lines. Further, GenomePaint correlates mutation and expression patterns with patient outcomes, and supports custom data upload. We used GenomePaint to unveil aberrant splicing that disrupts the RING domain of CREBBP, discover cis activation of the MYC oncogene by duplication of the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and explore the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity at EGFR in adult glioblastomas.

Tumor-related stress regulates functional plasticity of MDSCs	CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Cancer; MDSC; ER stress; Immunotherapy		"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) impair protective anti-tumor immunity and remain major obstacles that stymie the effectiveness of promising cancer therapies. Diverse tumor-derived stressors galvanize the differentiation, intra-tumoral expansion, and immunomodulatory function of MDSCs. These tumor-associated ?axes of stress? underwrite the immunosuppressive programming of MDSCs in cancer and contribute to the phenotypic/functional heterogeneity that characterize tumor-MDSCs. This review discusses various tumor-associated axes of stress that direct MDSC development, accumulation, and immunosuppressive function, as well as current strategies aimed at overcoming the detrimental impact of MDSCs in cancer. To better understand the constellation of signals directing MDSC biology, we herein summarize the pivotal roles, signaling mediators, and effects of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species related stress, chronic inflammatory stress, hypoxia-linked stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, metabolic stress, and therapy-associated stress on MDSCs. Although therapeutic targeting of these processes remains mostly pre-clinical, intercepting signaling through the axes of stress could overcome MDSC-related immune suppression in tumor bearing hosts."

However, the problem of dose-dependent systemic toxicity cannot be ignored. In this study, exosomes derived from mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted CAR-T cells were isolated, and we found that they maintain most characteristics of the parental T cells, including surface expression of the CARs and CD3. Furthermore, CAR-carrying exosomes significantly inhibited the growth of both endogenous and exogenous MSLN-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The expression of the effector molecules perforin and granzyme B may be a mechanism of tumor killing. More importantly, a highly effective tumor inhibition rate without obvious side effects was observed with the administration of CAR-T cell exosomes in vivo. Thus, the use of CAR-T cell exosomes has great therapeutic potential against MSLN-expressing TNBC."

CtIP is renowned for its role in the resection of DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs) during homologous recombination, a largely error-free DNA repair pathway crucial in maintaining genome integrity. However, CtIP-dependent DNA end resection is equally accountable for alternative end-joining, a mutagenic DSB repair mechanism implicated in oncogenic chromosomal translocations. In addition, CtIP contributes to transcriptional regulation of G1/S transition, DNA damage checkpoint signalling, and replication fork protection pathways. In this review, we present a perspective on the current state of knowledge regarding the tumour-suppressive and oncogenic properties of CtIP and provide an overview of their relevance for cancer development, progression, and therapy."

However, therapeutic resistance poses a major challenge to current immunotherapies. Here, we identify that expression of tumor stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) correlates with immunotherapy efficacy and is negatively associated with patient survival across diverse cancer types. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that tumor STC1 supports tumor progression and enables tumor resistance to checkpoint blockade in murine tumor models. Mechanistically, tumor STC1 interacts with calreticulin (CRT), an eat-me'' signal, and minimizes CRT membrane exposure, thereby abrogating membrane CRT-directed phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and dendritic cells. Consequently, this impairs APC capacity of antigen presentation and T cell activation. Thus, tumor STC1 inhibits APC phagocytosis and contributes to tumor immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance. We suggest that STC1 is a previously unappreciated phagocytosis checkpoint and targeting STC1 and its interaction with CRT may sensitize to cancer immunotherapy."

By deleting an essential autophagy gene or disrupting its autophagy function, we determined a mechanism of HER2+ breast cancer tumorigenesis by directly regulating the oncogenic driver. Disruption of FIP200-mediated autophagy reduced HER2 expression on the tumor cell surface and abolished mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-Neu mice. Decreased HER2 surface expression was due to trafficking from the Golgi to the endocytic pathways instead of the plasma membrane. Autophagy inhibition led to HER2 accumulation in early and late endosomes associated with intraluminal vesicles and released from tumor cells in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Increased HER2 release from sEVs correlated with reduced tumor cell surface levels. Blocking sEVs secretion rescued HER2 levels in tumor cells. Our results demonstrate a role for autophagy to promote tumorigenesis in HER2+ breast cancer. This suggests that blocking autophagy could supplement current anti-HER2 agents for treating the disease."

Molecular mechanisms for exceptional responses to therapy have been identified by genomic analysis of tumor biopsies from individual patients. Here, we analyzed tumor biopsies from an unbiased cohort of 111 exceptional responder patients using multiple platforms to profile genetic and epigenetic aberrations as well as the tumor microenvironment. Integrative analysis uncovered plausible mechanisms for the therapeutic response in nearly a quarter of the patients. The mechanisms were assigned to four broad categories-DNA damage response, intracellular signaling, immune engagement, and genetic alterations characteristic of favorable prognosis- with many tumors falling into multiple categories. These analyses revealed synthetic lethal relationships that may be exploited therapeutically and rare genetic lesions that favor therapeutic success, while also providing a wealth of testable hypotheses regarding oncogenic mechanisms that may influence the response to cancer therapy."

Polarity proteins are responsible for the arrangement of cells within epithelial tissues through the asymmetric organisation of cellular components. Partition defective 3 (PARD3) is a master regulator of the Par polarity complex primarily due to its ability to form large complexes via its self-homologous binding domain. In addition to its role in polarity, PARD3 is a scaffolding protein that binds to intracellular signalling molecules, many of which are frequently deregulated in cancer. The role of PARD3 has been implicated in multiple solid cancers as either a tumour suppressor or promoter. This dual functionality is both physiologically and cell context dependent. In this review, we will discuss PARD3's role in tumourigenesis in both laboratory and clinical settings. We will also review several of the mechanisms underpinning PARD3's function including its association with intracellular signalling pathways and its role in the regulation of asymmetric cell division."

Since their discovery, several mechanisms of RTK dysregulation have been identified, resulting in multiple cancer types displaying 'oncogenic addiction' to RTKs. As a result, RTKs have represented a major class for targeted therapeutics over the past two decades, with numerous small molecule-based tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapeutics having been developed and clinically approved for several cancers. However, many of the current RTK inhibitor treatments eventually result in the rapid development of acquired resistance and subsequent tumor relapse. Recent technological advances and tools are being generated for the identification of novel RTK small molecule therapeutics. These newer technologies will be important for the identification of diverse types of RTK inhibitors, targeting both the receptors themselves as well as key cellular factors that play important roles in the RTK signaling cascade."

Aggregation and amyloid formation of p53 is also implicated in cancer pathogenesis, but direct evidence for aggregated p53 amyloids acting as an oncogene is lacking. Here, we condusively demonstrate that wild-type p53 amyloid formation imparts oncogenic properties to non-cancerous cells. p53 amyloid aggregates were transferred through cell generations, contributing to enhanced survival, apoptotic resistance with increased proliferation and migration. The tumorigenic potential of p53 amyloid-transformed cells was further confirmed in mouse xenografts, wherein the tumors showed p53 amyloids. p53 disaggregation rescued the cellular transformation and inhibited tumor development in mice. We propose that wild-type p53 amyloid formation contributes to tumorigenesis and can be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

Recent research elucidated a large heterogeneity and plasticity of activated fibroblasts, indicating that their role in cancer initiation, growth and metastasis is complex and context-dependent. Here, we performed genome-wide expression analysis comparing fibroblasts in normal, inflammatory and tumour-associated skin. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit a fibrotic gene signature in wound-induced tumours, demonstrating persistent extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling within these tumours. A top upregulated gene in mouse CAFs encodes for PRSS35, a protease capable of collagen remodelling. In human skin, we observed PRSS35 expression uniquely in the stroma of high-grade squamous cell carcinomas. Ablation of PRSS35 in mouse models of wound- or chemically-induced tumorigenesis resulted in aberrant collagen composition in the ECM and increased tumour incidence. Our results indicate that fibrotic enzymes expressed by CAFs can regulate squamous tumour initiation by remodelling the ECM."

CD47/SIRP alpha phagocytosis checkpoint blockade has demonstrated therapeutic potential in several hematopoietic cancers, but recent clinical studies reported very limited efficacy against solid malignancies. Here, we show that polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, enhances the antitumor activity of CD47 blockade in colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo. Poly(I:C) activation leads to a potent immune response characterized by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6.

The role of autophagy in the pathobiology of CRC is intricate, with opposing functions manifested in different cellular contexts. The Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator inactivated by the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway, functions as an oncoprotein in a variety of cancers. In this study, we found that YAP could negatively regulate autophagy in CRC cells, and consequently, promote tumor progression of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YAP interacts with TEAD forming a complex to upregulate the transcription of the apoptosis-inhibitory protein Bcl-2, which may subsequently facilitate cell survival by suppressing autophagy-related cell death; silencing Bcl-2 expression could alleviate YAP-induced autophagy inhibition without affecting YAP expression.

In NSCLC tissue samples, GAS5 expression decreased significantly. Low GAS5 levels were positively correlated with NSCLC characteristics including TNM, tumor size and lymphatic metastasis. Functionally, GAS5 significantly reduced NSCLC/DDP cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in vitro. In vivo, GAS5 upregulation inhibited remarkably NSCLC/DDP cell tumor growth. Mechanism analysis suggested that GAS5 was a molecular sponge of miR-217, inhibiting the expression of phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP).

Many research publications discussing the mechanisms of anticancer drugs use the terms cell death and apoptosis interchangeably, given that apoptotic pathways are the most common components of the action of targeted and cytotoxic compounds. However, there is sound evidence suggesting that other mechanisms of drug-induced cell death, such as necroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, etc. may significantly contribute to the fate of cancer cells. Molecular cross-talks between apoptotic and nonapoptotic death pathways underlie the successes and the failures of therapeutic interventions. Here we discuss the nuances of the antitumor action of two groups of the widely used anticancer drugs, i.e., platinum salts and taxane derivatives.

LINC00662 significantly promotes OC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00662 is stabilized by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1). Moreover, LINC00662 exerts oncogenic effects by interacting with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and preventing its ubiquitination in OC cells, leading to activation of the oncogenic p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

Here, we show that tetraarsenic hexoxide induces the pyroptotic cell death through activation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME) pathway, thereby suppressing tumor growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Interestingly, tetraarsenic hexoxide-treated TNBC cells exhibited specific pyroptotic characteristics, including cell swelling, balloon-like bubbling, and LDH releases through pore formation in the plasma membrane, eventually suppressing tumor formation and lung metastasis of TNBC cells. Mechanistically, tetraarsenic hexoxide markedly enhanced the production of mitochondrial ROS by inhibiting phosphorylation of mitochondrial STAT3, subsequently inducing caspase-3-dependent cleavage of GSDME, which consequently promoted pyroptotic cell death in TNBC cells.

Mechanistic analyses showed that HYOU1 silencing promoted oxidative phosphorylation while inhibited aerobic glycolysis via downregulating LDHB at the posttranscriptional level.

However, the rules that govern which peptides are truly recognized by existing T cell receptors (TCRs) remain poorly understood, precluding accurate predictions of neo-epitopes for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we capitalize on recent (neo-)epitope data to train a predictor of immunogenic epitopes (PRIME), which captures molecular properties of both antigen presentation and TCR recognition. PRIME not only improves prioritization of neo-epitopes but also correlates with T cell potency and unravels biophysical determinants of TCR recognition that we experimentally validate.

Drug resistance is a crucial issue involving recurrence in cancer patients. Many studies on anti-cancer drugs have been reported using 2D culture systems, whereas 3D cultured tumoroids have many advantages for assessing drug sensitivity and resistance. Here, we aimed to investigate whether Cisplatin (a DNA crosslinker), Imatinib (a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU: an antimetabolite) alter the tumoroid growth of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Gene expression signatures of highly metastatic aggregative CRC (LuM1 cells) vs. low-metastatic, non-aggregative CRC (Colon26 and NM11 cells) were analyzed using microarray. To establish a 3D culture-based multiplexing reporter assay system, LuM1 was stably transfected with the Mmp9 promoter-driven ZsGreen fluorescence reporter gene, which was designated as LuM1/m9 cells and cultured in NanoCulture Plate(R), a gel-free 3D culture device. LuM1 cells highly expressed mRNA encoding ABCG2 (a drug resistance pump, i.e., CSC/CIC marker), other CSC/CIC markers (DLL1, EpCAM, podoplanin, STAT3/5), pluripotent stem cell markers (Sox4/7, N-myc, GATA3, Nanog), and metastatic markers (MMPs, Integrins, EGFR), compared to the other two cell types. Hoechst efflux stem cell-like side population was increased in LuM1 (7.8%) compared with Colon26 (2.9%), both of which were markedly reduced by verapamil treatment, an ABCG2 inhibitor. Smaller cell aggregates of LuM1 were more sensitive to Cisplatin (at 10 mu M), whereas larger tumoroids with increased ABCG2 expression were insensitive. Notably, Cisplatin (2 mu M) and Imatinib (10 mu M) at low concentrations significantly promoted tumoroid formation (cell aggregation) and increased Mmp9 promoter activity in mCRC LuM1/m9, while not cytotoxic to them. On the other hand, 5-FU significantly inhibited tumoroid growth, although not completely. Thus, drug resistance in cancer with increased stem cell properties was modeled using the gel-free 3D cultured tumoroid system. The tumoroid culture is useful and easily accessible for the assessment of drug sensitivity and resistance."

Downregulation of FABP5 suppressed cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the Hippo signaling pathway was related to FABP5. We found that overexpression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) could partially reverse the effect of FABP5 knockdown on growth and apoptosis. The FABP5 inhibitor SBFI-26 suppressed the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of gastric cancer (GC) cells and interfered with the Hippo signaling pathway by inhibiting YAP1.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review in order to describe the regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing, as well as its functions in tumor cells, from proliferation and apoptosis to invasion and metastasis, and from angiogenesis to metabolism. The abnormal splicing events contributed to tumor progression as oncogenic drivers and/or bystander factors. The alterations in splicing factors detected in tumors and other mis-splicing events (i.e., long non-coding and circular RNAs) in tumorigenesis were also included. The findings of recent therapeutic approaches targeting splicing catalysis and splicing regulatory proteins to modulate pathogenically spliced events (including tumor-specific neo-antigens for cancer immunotherapy) were introduced. The emerging RNA-based strategies for the treatment of cancer with abnormally alternative splicing isoforms were also discussed. However, further studies are still required to address the association between alternative splicing and cancer in more detail."

In recognition of the fact that the darkness hormone melatonin is capable of regulating bone homeostasis, we explored its therapeutic potential in bone metastasis. We found that melatonin directly reduces osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption activity and promotes apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. We also observed that melatonin inhibits RANKL production in lung and prostate cancer cells by downregulating the p38 MAPK pathway, which in turn prevents cancer-associated osteoclast differentiation. In lung and prostate bone metastasis models, twice-weekly melatonin treatment markedly reduced tumor volumes and numbers of osteolytic lesions. Melatonin also substantially lowered the numbers of TRAP-positive osteoclasts in tibia bone marrow and RANKL expression in tumor tissue. These findings show promise for melatonin in the treatment of bone metastases."

Processing bodies (P-bodies) are critical regulators of these processes. Here, we report that the Pim1 and 3 protein kinases bind to the P-body protein enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 (EDC3) and phosphorylate EDC3 on serine (S)161, thereby modifying P-body assembly. EDC3 phosphorylation is highly elevated in many tumor types, is reduced upon treatment of cells with kinase inhibitors, and blocks the localization of EDC3 to P-bodies. Prostate cancer cells harboring an EDC3 S161A mutation show markedly decreased growth, migration, and invasion in tissue culture and in xenograft models. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, the expression of integrin beta 1 and alpha 6 mRNA and protein is reduced in these mutated cells. These results demonstrate that EDC3 phosphorylation regulates multiple cancer-relevant functions and suggest that modulation of P-body activity may represent a new paradigm for cancer treatment."

In the US, there are notable disparities in early-onset CRC burden by race/ethnicity and geography. African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and populations residing in specific regions of the Southern U.S. are disproportionately affected with CRC diagnosed at younger ages, while less is known about disparities in other countries. Reasons for these disparities are likely multi-factorial and potentially implicate differences in health determinants including biology/genetics, diet/environment, individual health behaviors, and access to high-quality health services, as well as social and policy factors. This review summarizes current understanding of early-onset CRC disparities and identifies specific research areas that will inform evidence-based interventions at individual, practice, and policy levels to reduce the global burden of this disease."

Endosomal trafficking has been implicated in tumor metastasis, and we have previously found that small chemical vacuolin-1 (V1) potently inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and general endosomal-lysosomal degradation. Here, we assessed the anti-metastatic activity of V1 both in vitro and in vivo. V1 significantly inhibits colony formation, migration, and invasion of various cancer cells in vitro. It also compromises the assembly-disassembly dynamics of focal adhesions (FAs) by inhibiting the recycling and degradation of integrins. In various experimental or transgenic mouse models, V1 significantly suppresses the metastasis and/or tumor growth of breast cancer or melanoma. We further identified capping protein Z beta (CapZ beta) as a V1 binding protein and showed that it is required for the V1-mediated inhibition of migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate that V1 targets CapZ beta to inhibit endosomal trafficking and metastasis."

To further characterize the role of CD43 in cell transformation, we tested whether interfering its expression modified the capacity of the A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells to secrete molecules contributing to malignancy. The proteomic analysis of the secretome of serum-starved A549 cells revealed that cells expressing normal levels of CD43 released significantly high levels of molecules involved in extracellular matrix organization, angiogenesis, platelet degranulation, collagen degradation, and inflammation, as compared to CD43 RNAi cells. This data reveals a novel and unexpected role for CD43 in lung cancer development, mainly in remodeling the tumor microenvironment."

Various metabolic alterations and epigenetic modifications also reportedly drive immune escape or impede immunosurveillance within certain contexts, playing important roles in tumor progression. In this review, we focus on how metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and immune cells reshapes epigenetic alterations, in particular the acetylation and methylation of histone proteins and DNA.

However, the role of senescent CAFs in metastatic lesions and the molecular mechanism of inflammation-related SASP induction are not well understood. We show that pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven EZH2 downregulation maintains the SASP by demethylating H3K27me3 marks in CAFs and enhances peritoneal tumor formation of gastric cancer (GC) through JAK/STAT3 signaling in a mouse model. A JAK/STAT3 inhibitor blocks the increase in GC cell viability induced by senescent CAFs and peritoneal tumor formation. Single-cell mass cytometry revealed that fibroblasts exist in the ascites of GC patients with peritoneal dissemination, and the fibroblast population shows p16 expression and SASP factors at high levels. These findings provide insights into the inflammation-related SASP maintenance by histone modification and the role of senescent CAFs in GC peritoneal dissemination."

Here, we track the transitions and heritability of metabolic states in single PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells, identify non-genetic glycolytic heterogeneity, and build on observations derived from methods reliant on bulk analyses, Using fluorescent biosensors in vitro and in tumors, we have identified distinct subpopulations of cells whose glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism are regulated by combinations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, bromodomain activity, and cell crowding effects. The actin severing protein cofilin, as well as PI3K, regulates rapid changes in glucose metabolism, whereas treatment with the bromodomain inhibitor slowly abrogates a subpopulation of cells whose glycolytic activity is PI3K independent. We show how bromodomain function and PI3K signaling, along with actin remodeling, independently modulate glycolysis and how targeting these pathways affects distinct subpopulations of cancer cells."

Mutant p53 suppresses innate immune signaling to promote tumorigenesis	CANCER CELL			English	Article							CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY; CANCER; INFLAMMATION; METASTASIS; ACTIVATION; SENESCENCE; EXPRESSION; COOPERATE; APOPTOSIS; TRIGGERS	"Mutant p53 (mtp53) proteins can exert cancer-promoting gain-of-function activities. We report a mechanism by which mtp53 suppresses both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous signaling to promote cancer cell survival and evasion of tumor immune surveillance. Mtp53 interferes with the function of the cytoplasmic DNA sensing machinery, cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3, that activates the innate immune response. Mtp53, but not wild-type p53, binds to TANK-binding protein kinase 1 (TBK1) and prevents the formation of a trimeric complex between TBK1, STING, and IRF3, which is required for activation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of IRF3. Inactivation of innate immune signaling by mtp53 alters cytokine production, resulting in immune evasion. Restoring TBK1 signaling is sufficient to bypass mtp53 and lead to restored immune cell function and cancer cell eradication. This work is of translational interest because therapeutic approaches that restore TBK1 function could potentially reactivate immune surveillance and eliminate mtp53 tumors."

Evidences have been provided that both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to the regulation of the formation and stemness maintenance as well as the therapeutic resistance of CSCs via affecting various signal pathways. In addition, the interaction between CSCs and tumor microenvironment has also been revealed to be involved in the above-described processes. With the aim of targeting CSCs to improve treatment outcome, we herein discuss the mechanisms that orchestrate the characteristic of CSCs by the three elements and potential therapeutic strategies. We also summarize how several key regulatory factors function in the regulation of not only the formation and stemness maintenance, but also the therapeutic resistance of CSCs. Thus, future studies focusing on these key factors would be helpful for the development of novel drugs targeting CSCs."

We propose a computational model that reproduces the functionality of membrane transporters by quantifying the flow of substrates through the cell membrane. The model identifies the force induced by conformational changes of the transporter due to hydrolysis of ATP, in ABC transporters, or by an electrochemical gradient of ions, in secondary transporters. The transport rate is computed by averaging the velocity generated by the force along the paths followed by the substrates. The results obtained are in accordance with the experiments. The model provides an overall framework for analyzing the membrane transport proteins that regulate the flows of ions, nutrients and other molecules across the cell membranes, and their activities."

Here, the role and mechanism of HCP5 in regulating the chemoresistance of GC to cisplatin (DDP) was investigated. Our results revealed that HCP5 was increased in GC patients and indicated a poor prognosis. HCP5 knockdown weakens DDP resistance and reduced apoptosis of GC cells. miR-128 was decreased in GC patients and sponged by HCP5. HMGA2 was targeted by miR-128 and was increased in GC patients. HCP5 aggravated the resistance of GC cells to DDP in vitro by elevating HMGA2 expression via sponging miR-128. HCP5 silencing inhibited GC cells growth, resistance to DDP, and Ki-67 expression in vivo. In summary, HCP5 contributed to DDP resistance in GC cells through miR-128/HMGA2 axis, providing a promising therapeutic target for GC chemoresistance."

Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy is a major clinical problem and substantial research is ongoing into potential methods of overcoming this resistance. One major target, the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, has generated increasing interest with multiple clinical trials in progress. Overexpression of MET is frequently observed in a range of different cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that MET promotes resistance to targeted therapies, including those targeting EGFR, BRAF and MEK. More recently, several reports suggest that MET also contributes to cytotoxic chemotherapy resistance.

Signaling pathways studies can result in the identification of targets to interrupt cancer progression. Glypicans are cell surface proteoglycans linked to the membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol. Their interaction with specific ligands has been reported to trigger diverse signaling, including Wnt. In this study, prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP were compared to normal prostate RWPE-1 cell line to investigate glypican family members and the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Results Glypican-1 (GPC1) was highly expressed in all the examined cell lines, except for LNCaP, which expressed glypican-5 (GPC5). The subcellular localization of GPC1 was detected on the cell surface of RWPE-1, PC-3, and DU-145 cell lines, while GPC5 suggested cytoplasm localization in LNCaP cells. Besides glypican, flow cytometry analysis in these prostate cell lines confirmed the expression of Wnt-3a and unphosphorylated beta-catenin. The co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed increased levels of binding between Wnt-3a and glypicans in cancer cells, suggesting a relationship between these proteoglycans in this pathway. A marked increase in nuclear beta-catenin was observed in tumor cells. However, only PC-3 cells demonstrated activation of canonical Wnt signaling, according to the TOPFLASH assay. Conclusions GPC1 was the majorly expressed gene in all the studied cell lines, except for LNCaP, which expressed GPC5. We assessed by co-immunoprecipitation that these GPCs could interact with Wnt-3a. However, even though nuclear beta-catenin was found increased in the prostate cancer cells (i.e., PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP), activation of Wnt pathway was only found in PC-3 cells. In these PC-3 cells, GPC1 and Wnt-3a revealed high levels of colocalization, as assessed by confocal microscopy studies. This suggests a localization at the cellular surface, where Frizzled receptor is required for downstream activation. The interaction of Wnt-3a with GPCs in DU-145 and LNCaP cells, which occurs in absence of Wnt signaling activation, requires further studies. Once non-TCF-LEF proteins can also bind beta-catenin, another signaling pathway may be involved in these cells with regulatory function."

Tumor and immune reprogramming during immunotherapy in advanced renal cell carcinoma	CANCER CELL			English	Article							EXPRESSION; PROTEIN; GENE; MACROPHAGES; KNOWLEDGE; PD-L1; ATLAS	"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) results in durable disease control in a subset of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but mechanisms driving resistance are poorly understood. We characterize the single-cell transcriptomes of cancer and immune cells from metastatic RCC patients before or after ICB exposure. In responders, subsets of cytotoxic T cells express higher levels of co-inhibitory receptors and effector molecules. Macrophages from treated biopsies shift toward pro-inflammatory states in response to an interferon-rich microenvironment but also upregulate immunosuppressive markers. In cancer cells, we identify bifurcation into two subpopulations differing in angiogenic signaling and upregulation of immunosuppressive programs after ICB. Expression signatures for cancer cell subpopulations and immune evasion are associated with PBRM1 mutation and survival in primary and ICB-treated advanced RCC. Our findings demonstrate that ICB remodels the RCC microenvironment and modifies the interplay between cancer and immune cell populations critical for understanding response and resistance to ICB."

However, the mechanism of the metabolic switch is not fully understood. Here, we found that the S-nitrosoproteomic profile of endogenous nitrogen oxide in ovarian cancer cells targeted multiple components in metabolism processes. Phosphofructokinase (PFKM), one of the most important regulatory enzymes of glycolysis, was S-nitrosylated by nitric oxide synthase NOS1 at Cys351. S-nitrosylation at Cys351 stabilized the tetramer of PFKM, leading to resist negative feedback of downstream metabolic intermediates. The PFKM-C351S mutation decreased the proliferation rate of cultured cancer cells, and reduced tumor growth and metastasis in the mouse xenograft model. These findings indicated that S-nitrosylation at Cys351 of PFKM by NOS1 contributes to the metabolic reprogramming of ovarian cancer cells, highlighting a critical role of endogenous nitrogen oxide on metabolism regulations in tumor progression."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer of the digestive system. However, effective therapeutic targets against CRC have not been found yet. Further, the relationship between the expression of ring finger protein 126 (RNF126) and CRC is not clear. Material and Methods. The expression level of RNF126 in CRC tissues and cell lines was detected by immunohistochemical staining and western blot. Subsequently, endogenous RNFI26 expression was inhibited in a CRC cell line using a short hairpin RNA. Next, the effect of RNF126 on the properties of CRC cells was studied through different experimental methods. Results. We found that the RNF126 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. High RNF126 expression was observed to be an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in CRC patients. In vitro studies showed that RNF126 was able to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of CRC cells. Conclusion. RNF126 acts as an oncogene during CRC development, and may serve as a novel target for CRC treatment."

However, their dysfunction in the hostile tumor microenvironment remains a pivotal barrier for cancer immunotherapies against solid tumors. Using cancer patient samples and proteomics, we found that human NK cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment is due to suppression of glucose metabolism via lipid peroxidation-associated oxidative stress, Activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway restored NK cell metabolism and function and resulted in greater anti-tumor activity in vivo. Strikingly, expanded NK cells reprogrammed with complete metabolic substrate flexibility not only sustained metabolic fitness but paradoxically augmented their tumor killing in the tumor microenvironment and in response to nutrient deprivation. Our results uncover that metabolic flexibility enables a cytotoxic immune cell to exploit the metabolic hostility of tumors for their advantage, addressing a critical hurdle for cancer immunotherapy."

The gold standard for determining MSI status has traditionally been fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE). However, its use in the clinical setting has diminished and has been replaced by immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of loss of mismatch repair protein expression due to practicability and cost. The aim of this study was to develop a simple, cost-effective and accurate MSI assay based on CGE. Method: After amplification of microsatellites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) panel (BAT 25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123, D17S250) of MSI markers, parallel CGE was utilized to classify colorectal cancers as MSI-H, MSI-L and MSS using the 5200 Fragment Analyzer System. Cell lines and patient cancer specimens were tested. DNA from 56 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cancer specimens and matched normal tissue were extracted and CGE was performed. An automated computational algorithm for MSI status determination was also developed. Results: Using the fragment analyser, MSI status was found to be 100% concordant with the known MSI status of cell lines and was 86% and 87% concordant with immunohistochemistry (IHC) from patient cancer specimens using traditional assessment and our MSI scoring system, respectively, for MSI determination. The misclassification rate was mainly attributed to IHC, with only one (1.8%) sampling error attributed to CGE testing. CGE was also able to distinguish MSI-L from MSI-H and MSS, which is not possible with IHC. An MSI score based on total allelic variability that can accurately determine MSI status was also successfully developed. A significant reduction in cost compared with traditional fluorescent multiplex PCR and CGE was achieved with this technique. Conclusions: A simple, cost-effective and reliable method of determining MSI status and an MSI scoring system based on an automatic computational algorithm to determine MSI status, as well as degree of allelic instability in colorectal cancer, has been developed using the 5200 Fragment Analyzer System."

FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Review						PAKs; cancer; disease; mechanism; inhibitor	BETA-CATENIN	"The p21-activated kinases (PAKs), downstream effectors of Ras-related Rho GTPase Cdc42 and Rac, are serine/threonine kinases. Biologically, PAKs participate in various cellular processes, including growth, apoptosis, mitosis, immune response, motility, inflammation, and gene expression, making PAKs the nexus of several pathogenic and oncogenic signaling pathways. PAKs were proved to play critical roles in human diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, neurological disorders, diabetes, pancreatic acinar diseases, and cardiac disorders. In this review, we systematically discuss the structure, function, alteration, and molecular mechanisms of PAKs that are involved in the pathogenic and oncogenic effects, as well as PAK inhibitors, which may be developed and deployed in cancer therapy, anti-viral infection, and other diseases. Furthermore, we highlight the critical questions of PAKs in future research, which provide an opportunity to offer input and guidance on new directions for PAKs in pathogenic, oncogenic, and drug discovery research."

This co-deletion leads to aggressive tumors with poor prognosis that lack effective, molecularly targeted therapies. The metabolic enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A) was identified as a synthetic lethal target in MTAP-deleted cancers. We report the characterization of potent MAT2A inhibitors that substantially reduce levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and demonstrate antiproliferative activity in MTAP-deleted cancer cells and tumors. Using RNA sequencing and proteomics, we demonstrate that MAT2A inhibition is mechanistically linked to reduced protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) activity and splicing perturbations. We further show that DNA damage and mitotic defects ensue upon MAT2A inhibition in HCT116 MTAP(-/-) cells, providing a rationale for combining the MAT2A clinical candidate AG-270 with antimitotic taxanes."

However, there are accumulating shreds of evidence showing that KIBRA has an oncogenic function, which we speculate may arise from its functions away from the Hippo pathway.

We used cysteine-specific isotopic coded affinity tags (OxICAT) and gel-free mass spectrometry analysis to investigate the cysteine Ox-PTMs profile in the proteome of both plantaris (glycolytic) and soleus (oxidative) muscles in tumor-bearing and control rats. Histological analysis revealed muscle atrophy in type II fibers in plantaris muscle, with no changes in plantaris type I fibers and no differences in both soleus type I and II fibers in tumor-bearing rats when compared to healthy controls. Tumor progression altered the Ox-PTMs profile in both plantaris and soleus. However, pathway analysis including the differentially oxidized proteins revealed tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation as main affected pathways in plantaris muscle from tumor-bearing rats, while the same analysis did not show main metabolic pathways affected in the soleus muscle. In addition, cancer progression affected several metabolic parameters such as ATP levels and markers of oxidative stress associated with muscle atrophy in plantaris muscle, but not in soleus. However, isolated soleus from tumor-bearing rats had a reduced force production capacity when compared to controls. These novel findings demonstrate that tumor-bearing rats have severe muscle atrophy exclusively in glycolytic fibers. Cancer progression is associated with cysteine Ox-PTMs in the skeletal muscle, but these modifications affect different pathways in a glycolytic muscle compared to an oxidative muscle, indicating that intrinsic muscle oxidative capacity determines the response to cancer cachectic effects."

Such GRNs are encoded in the genome and frequently conserved among species. Considering that all metazoa have evolved from a common ancestor via major macroevolutionary events which shaped those GRNs and increased morphogenetic complexity, we sought to examine whether there are any key innovations that may be consistently and deterministically linked with metastatic potential across the metazoa clades. To address tumor evolution relative to organismal evolution, we revisited and retrospectively juxtaposed seminal laboratory and field cancer studies across taxa that lie on the evolutionary lineage from cnidaria to humans. We subsequently applied bioinformatics to integrate species-specific cancer phenotypes, multiomics data from up to 42 human cancer types, developmental phenotypes of knockout mice, and molecular phylogenetics. We found that the phenotypic manifestations of metastasis appear to coincide with agnatha-to-gnathostome transition. Genes indispensable for jaw development, a key innovation of gnathostomes, undergo mutations or methylation alterations, are aberrantly transcribed during tumor progression and are causatively associated with invasion and metastasis. There is a preference for deregulation of gnathostome-specific versus pre-gnathostome genes occupying hubs of the jaw development network. According to these data, we propose our systems-based model as an in silico tool the prediction of likely tumor evolutionary trajectories and therapeutic targets for metastasis prevention, on the rationale that the same genes which are essential for key innovations that catalyzed vertebrate evolution, such as jaws, are also important for tumor evolution."

We previously identified a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12C7, which presented anti-tumor activity in lung cancer stem cells (LCSCs). Here, we aimed to identify the target antigen for 12C7 and confirm its role in LCSCs.MethodsImmunofluorescence was used for antigen localization. After targeted antigen purification by electrophoresis and immunoblot, the antigen was identified by LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation. The overexpression or silence of ENO1 was induced by lentiviral transduction. Self-renewal, growth, and invasion of LCSCs were evaluated by sphere formation, colony formation, and invasion assay, respectively. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to analyze downstream targets and pathways of targeted antigen.ResultsTargeted antigen showed a surface antigen expression pattern, and the 43-55kDa protein band was identified as alpha -enolase (ENO1). Self-renewal, growth, and invasion abilities of LCSCs were remarkably inhibited by ENO1 downregulation, while enhanced by ENO1 upregulation. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis eventually screened 4 self-renewal-related and 6 invasion-related differentially expressed genes. GSEA analysis and qRT-PCR verified that ENO1 regulated self-renewal, invasion-related genes, and pathways. KEGG pathway analysis and immunoblot demonstrated that ENO1 inactivated AMPK pathway and activated mTOR pathway in LCSCs.ConclusionsENO1 is identified as a targeted antigen of mAb 12C7 and plays a pivotal role in facilitating self-renewal, growth, and invasion of LCSCs. These findings provide a potent therapeutic target for the stem cell therapy for lung cancer and have potential to improve the anti-tumor activity of 12C7."

Our initial analysis identified CXCL5 as a cancer-related gene highly expressed in PC. Patients with PC exhibited markedly higher preoperative serum CXCL5 levels compared with that in healthy individuals (P<0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.880 with the sensitivity of 84.0%, and specificity of 80.4% to distinguish PC. Serum CXCL5 levels were also significantly decreased following tumor resection in patients with PC (P=0.001). Preoperative serum CXCL5 level was significantly associated with clinicopathological characteristics including T stage (P=0.001), nodal status (P<0.001), and pelvic lymph node metastasis (P=0.018). Cox regression analysis showed that serum CXCL5 level could serve as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival with a HR of 6.363 (95% CI: 2.185-18.531, P=0.001). CXCL5 and its receptor CXCR2 exhibited correlated expression pattern in PC tissues. Differential CXCL5 expression was observed in normal penile tissues, PC cell lines, and their culture supernatants. Furthermore, knockdown of CXCL5 or CXCR2 expression markedly suppressed malignant phenotypes (cell proliferation, clonogenesis, apoptosis escape, migration, and invasion), attenuated STAT3 and AKT signaling, and reduced MMP2/9 secretion in PC cell lines. In conclusion, our findings revealed that serum CXCL5 level might serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarker for penile cancer. Autocrine CXCL5/CXCR2 signaling might activate multiple downstream oncogenic signaling pathways (STAT3, AKT, MMP2/9) to promote malignant progression of PC, which may warrant further investigation in the future."

Demonstration of dMMR via the immunohistochemical assessment of MMR proteins is useful when screening for inherited cancer syndromes (especially Lynch syndrome) and for the prediction of clinical cancer response to conventional chemotherapy and novel immunotherapies. Identification of dMMR may also be helpful in other situations e.g. when considering a diagnosis of conventional dysplasia in sessile serrated lesions of the large intestine. This article provides a practical illustrated guide to DNA MMR interpretation, using a series of clinical examples."

Here we used the murine MR CTLD4-7 coupled to the Fc-portion of human IgG (MR-Fc) to investigate the MR glycan and glycoprotein recognition. We probed 16 different cancer and control tissues using the MR-Fc, and observed cell- and tissue-specific binding with varying intensity. All cancer tissues and several control tissues exhibited MR-Fc ligands, intracellular and/or surface-located. We further confirmed the presence of ligands on the surface of cancer cells by flow cytometry. To characterize the fine specificity of the MR for glycans, we screened a panel of glycan microarrays. Remarkably, the results indicate that the CTLD4-7 of the MR is highly selective for specific types of pauci- and oligomannose N-glycans among hundreds of glycans tested. As lung cancer tissue and the lung cancer cell line A549 showed intense MR-Fc binding, we further investigated the MR glycoprotein ligands in those cells by immunoprecipitation and glycoproteomic analysis. All enriched glycoproteins, of which 42 were identified, contained pauci- or oligomannose N-glycans, confirming the microarray results. Our study demonstrates that the MR CTLD4-7 is highly selective for pauci- and oligomannosidic N-glycans, structures that are often elevated in tumor cells, and suggest a potential role for the MR in tumor biology."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy exhibits a therapeutic effect via different mechanisms. By using MSCs as carrier cells, the major problem of clearance of oncolytic viruses is resolved by neutralizing antibodies before they react with cancer cells. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of infected MSCs by reovirus type-3 Dearing (T3D) for in vitro cancer therapy. Adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) were infected with reovirus T3D and its biological properties were evaluated. Then, the effects of reovirus-infected AD-MSCs on cytokine profile, nitric oxide (NO) production, and apoptosis induction in TC-1 cells were assessed. Our results indicated that the differentiation potential of AD-MSCs was affected by reovirus. However, phenotypes were not affected after infection. Then, the effects of reovirus-infected AD-MSCs in TC-1 cells showed an increased amount of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and NO production and a decreased amount of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Moreover, apoptosis significantly increased via coculturing of TC-1 cells with infected AD-MSCs, compared with control, and both internal and external apoptosis pathways are activated in experimental groups. In conclusion, the data showed that with increasing TNF-alpha and NO production and reducing IL-10 and TGF-beta production, AD-MSCs can enhance the oncolytic effect of reovirus in cancer cells. Furthermore, the results suggested that AD-MSCs can be used as effective carrier cells candidate for reovirus T3D to maximize their anticancer cell activity."

Current gold standard treatments for advanced HNSCC rely primarily on radiotherapy and chemotherapy but with limited efficacy and significant side effects. In this study, we characterized a novel 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) carrier composed of chitosan solution (CS) and polycaprolactone (PCL) microparticles (MPs) in HNSCC preclinical models. The designed MPs were evaluated for their size, morphology, drug entrapment efficiency (EE%) and in vitro drug release profile. The anticancer activity of 5-FU-loaded particles was assessed in HNSCC human cell lines (CAL27 and HSC3) and in a preclinical mouse model (AT84) utilizing cell proliferation and survival, cell motility, and autophagy endpoints. The results demonstrated a 38.57 % in 5-FU entrapment efficiency associated with reduced 5-FU in vitro release up to 96 h post-exposure. Furthermore, CS-decorated PCL MPs were able to promote a significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation based on the metabolic and colony formation assays, in comparison to controls. In contrast, CS-decorated PCL MPs did not influence the pharmacological efficacy of 5-FU to inhibit in vitro cancer cell migration. Last, cell protein analysis revealed a significant increase of autophagy and cell death evaluated by LC3-II expression and PARP1 cleavage, respectively. In summary, these results support the potential utility of CSdecorated PCL MPs as an effective 5-FU-delivery carrier to improve HNSCC therapeutic management."

The main tumor marker used in this disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), does not provide information related to this tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells secrete exosomes carrying bioactive molecules contributing to MDSCs recruitment and induction. The ai m of this study was to characterize the perioperative changes of exosomal cytokines relevant in MDSCs recruitment induced by pros-tatectomy in prostate cancer patients. Methods: Blood was drawn from 26 early-stage prostate cancer patients before and after radical prostatectomy and from 16 healthy volunteers. Serum exosomes were separated by precipitation . Cytokines related with MDSC ce l l recruitment and activation CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL12, MIF, S100A9 and TGF-? were measured in serum and serum-derived exosomes using immunometric assays. Results: A l l cytokines were detected both in serum and exosomes, except for CXCL12, which was detected only in serum. Exosomes were enriched specially in MIF, TGF-? and CXCL2. Presurgical MIF levels in exosomes corre-lated negatively with serum PSA . Also, presurgical TGF-? decreased both in ser u m and exosomes as Gleason score rises. Patients ? presurgical exosomes had increased CCL2, CXCL5 and TGF-? levels than exosomes from healthy controls. These differences were not observed when cytokines were analyzed in serum, except for TGF-?. Cytokine levels of CCL2, CXCL5 decreased in patients? postsurgical exosomes, while TGF-? further increased. On the contrary, S100A9 levels were lower in patients ? presurgical exosomes but increased after radical prostatectomy. Conclusions: Blood exosomal content in cytokines constitute an attractive source to evaluate MDSCs immuno-modulators providing additional information related to tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer."

Their effects differ by the initial flare of gonadotropin and testosterone secretion with agonists and the immediate pituitary-testicular suppression by antagonists. While both suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) initially, a rebound in FSH levels occurs during agonist treatment. This rebound is potentially harmful, taken the expression of FSH receptors (R) in prostate cancer tissue. We herein assessed the role of FSH in promoting the growth of androgen-independent (PC-3, DU145) and androgen-dependent (VCaP) human prostate cancer cell line xenografts in nude mice. Gonadotropins were suppressed with the GnRH antagonist degarelix, and effects of add-back human recombinant FSH were assessed on tumor growth. All tumors expressed GnRHR and FSHR, and degarelix treatment suppressed their growth. FSH supplementation reversed the degarelix-evoked suppression of PC-3 tumors, both in preventive (degarelix and FSH treatment started upon cell inoculation) and therapeutic (treatments initiated 3 weeks after cell inoculation) setting. A less marked, though significant FSH effect occurred in DU145, but not in VCaP xenografts. FSHR expression in the xenografts supports direct FSH stimulation of tumor growth. Testosterone supplementation, to maintain the VCaP xenografts, apparently masked the FSH effect on their growth. Treatment with the LH analogue hCG did not affect PC-3 tumor growth despite their expression of luteinizing hormone/choriongonadotropin receptor. In conclusion, FSH, but not LH, may directly stimulate the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer, suggesting that persistent FSH suppression upon GnRH antagonist treatment offers a therapeutic advantage over agonist."

However, the lncRNA expression profiles and their roles and action mechanisms in ovarian cancer (OC) are largely unknown. Here, we assessed the lncRNA expression profiles in OC tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and one upregulated lncRNA, LINC01969, was selected for further study. LINC01969 expression levels in 41 patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The in vitro effects of LINC01969 on OC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation were determined by the CCK-8, ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU), wound healing, and Transwell assays. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The molecular mechanisms of LINC01969 in OC were assessed through bioinformatics analysis, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), dual luciferase reporter gene assays, and a rescue experiment. Finally, in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the functions of LINC01969. The results of the current study showed that LINC01969 was dramatically upregulated in OC, and patients with lower LINC01969 expression levels tended to have better overall survival. Further experiments demonstrated that LINC01969 promoted the migration, invasion, and proliferation of OC cells in vitro and sped up tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, LINC01969, which primarily exists in the cytoplasm, boosted LARP1 expression by sponging miR-144-5p and promoted the malignant phenotypes of OC cells. In conclusion, the LINC01969/miR-144-5p/LARP1 axis is a newly identified regulatory signaling pathway involved in OC progression."

The lack of understanding of the molecular etiology of gastric cancer (GC) poses a substantial challenge to the development of effective cancer therapy. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GC, which will facilitate the identification and development of effective therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes, mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to map the global molecular changes in GC. A total of 530 proteins with altered phosphorylation levels were detected across a panel of 15 normal and GC cell lines. WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) was validated to be upregulated in a subset of GC cell lines. WBP2 is overexpressed in 61% cases of GC compared to non-cancer tissues and high WBP2 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes. WBP2 was found to be required for GC cell migration but is dispensable for cell growth and proliferation. WBP2 knockdown increased p-LATS2 with a concomitant increase in p-YAP, resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of YAP and ultimately the inhibition of YAP/TEAD activity and downregulation of TEAD target genes--CTGF and CYR61. Importantly, the loss of LATS2 reversed the activation of Hippo pathway caused by WBP2 knockdown, indicating that WBP2 acts through LATS2 to exert its function on the Hippo pathway. Moreover, WBP2 interacted with LATS2 to inhibit its phosphorylation and activity. In conclusion, our study established a pivotal role for WBP2 in the promotion of GC cell migration via a novel mechanism that inactivates the Hippo pathway transducer LATS2."

Therefore, myeloid cells are described as cells that arise in the bone marrow. They can be distinguished from lymphoid cells based on their different differentiation trajectories-Lymphoid cells (B and T cells) are usually born in the bone marrow, but they need to migrate to lymphoid organs to mature and differentiate usually in response to antigens produced due to infections and diseases like cancer. On the other hand, myeloid cells do not follow this differentiation trajectory. They arise from the bone marrow, and do not need an encounter with antigens to gain their functionality. Thus, while lymphoid cells are a part of the adaptive immune system, myeloid cells are a part of the innate immune system. Hematopoiesis gives rise to two progenitor cells-the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The CMP can give rise to megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, mast cells and myeloblasts. Myeloblasts in turn lead to the formation of basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes that can further differentiate into macrophages. This review will focus on macrophages as well as the phenotypes they acquire with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It will address how cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) recruit macrophages and may switch to recruiting neutrophils upon depletion of these tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Finally, it will also shed light on past and current treatment options that specifically target these cells and how those affect patient outcomes in TNBC."	"[Singh, Swarnima; Zhang, Xiang H.

Here, we examined the interaction of ANL with human hepatocellular and colon cancer cells, evaluated its anti-cancer activity and diagnostic potential to detect aberrantly glycosylated tumour-associated serum glycoproteins such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). We observed that ANL strongly bound to both HepG2 and HT-29 cell-lines and this interaction was effectively blocked with L-fucose and mucin in a dose and time-dependent manner with an IC50 of 1.25 and 5 mu g/mL for HepG2 and HT-29 cells respectively at 48 hours. ANL treatment increased hypodiploidy and decreased the number of HepG2 cell in G(0)-G(1) phase at both 24 and 48 hours. Furthermore, ANL increased the level of apoptosis in both HepG2 and HT-29 cells in a time-dependent manner via enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and altered mitochondrial membrane potential, indicative of intrinsic apoptotis pathway activation. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the time-dependent elevation of levels of cytochrome c, initiator caspase-9 and activation of caspase-3. ANL immunohistochemistry on colon cancer tissue and quantification of AFP in HCC patient serum samples by developing an ANL-anti-AFP antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the diagnostic potential of ANL. Here, interaction of ANL with AFP could be effectively blocked in the presence of competing fucose-bearing glycans. We found ANL to be more sensitive than Lens culinaris lectin, a well-known fucose-specific lectin and currently used diagnostic agent. ANL can be further explored as a diagnostic and anti-cancer agent."

Present study was carried out to study the effect of three biotic elicitors, yeast extract, pectin, and valine, on the cytotoxicity activity of the bioactive compounds produced in the cell suspension culture of E. longifolia against human colon cancer cell lines. Yeast extract consists of vitamin B complex, chitin, N-acetyl-glucosamin, beta-glucan, glycopeptide, and ergosterol, while pectin contains cell wall components. Yeast extract and pectin, along with the branched chain amino acid valine, were evaluated as biotic elicitors to trigger the production of plant defense-related compounds. The different stages of cell growth influenced the production of the bioactive compounds; hence the administration of the elicitors at different stage of cell growth is vital for enhancement of their production. The results showed that all three biotic elicitors were effective in enhancing cytotoxic activity similar to that of root extract from the mature plant against human colon cancer cell line, HCT116, without affecting its cell growth. Crude extract derived from cells elicited with 2.0 g L-1 pectin supplemented on the 17(th) d showed good inhibition of HCT116 cell proliferation with IC50 of 19.4 mu g mL(-1). Hence, cell suspension culture of E. longifolia with elicitation is an alternative time-saving tool for production of valuable anti-cancer compounds and the conservation of this valuable plant due to indiscriminate harvesting from its natural habitat."

CUP occupies approximately 5% of cancer incidences in the United States with usually unfavorable prognosis, making it a big threat to public health. Traditional methods to identify the tissue-of-origin (TOO) of CUP like immunohistochemistry can only deal with around 20% CUP patients. In recent years, more and more studies suggest that it is promising to solve the problem by integrating machine learning techniques with big biomedical data involving multiple types of biomarkers including epigenetic, genetic, and gene expression profiles, such as DNA methylation. Different biomarkers play different roles in cancer research; for example, genomic mutations in a patient's tumor could lead to specific anticancer drugs for treatment; DNA methylation and copy number variation could reveal tumor tissue of origin and molecular classification. However, there is no systematic comparison on which biomarker is better at identifying the cancer type and site of origin. In addition, it might also be possible to further improve the inference accuracy by integrating multiple types of biomarkers. In this study, we used primary tumor data rather than metastatic tumor data. Although the use of primary tumors may lead to some biases in our classification model, their tumor-of-origins are known. In addition, previous studies have suggested that the CUP prediction model built from primary tumors could efficiently predict TOO of metastatic cancers (Lal et al., 2013; Brachtel et al., 2016). We systematically compared the performances of three types of biomarkers including DNA methylation, gene expression profile, and somatic mutation as well as their combinations in inferring the TOO of CUP patients. First, we downloaded the gene expression profile, somatic mutation and DNA methylation data of 7,224 tumor samples across 21 common cancer types from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and generated seven different feature matrices through various combinations. Second, we performed feature selection by the Pearson correlation method. The selected features for each matrix were used to build up an XGBoost multi-label classification model to infer cancer TOO, an algorithm proven to be effective in a few previous studies. The performance of each biomarker and combination was compared by the 10-fold cross-validation process. Our results showed that the TOO tracing accuracy using gene expression profile was the highest, followed by DNA methylation, while somatic mutation performed the worst. Meanwhile, we found that simply combining multiple biomarkers does not have much effect in improving prediction accuracy."

The pathophysiologic function of missense mutations in Smad4 is not fully understood. They usually map to the MH2 domain, specifically to residues that are involved in heterodimeric complex formation with regulatory Smads (such as Smad2/3) and ensuing transcriptional activation. These detrimental effects suggest that SMAD4 missense mutations can be categorized as loss-of-function. However, they tend to cluster in a few hotspots, which is more consistent with them acting by a gain-of-function mechanism. In this study, we investigated the functional role of Smad4 R361 mutants by re-expressing two R361 Smad4 variants in several Smad4-null colorectal cancer cell lines. As predicted, R361 mutations disrupted Smad2/3-Smad4 heteromeric complex formation and abolished canonical TGFb signaling. In that, they were similar to SMAD4 loss. However, RNA sequencing and subsequent RT-PCR assays revealed that Smad4-mut cells acquired a gene signature associated with enhanced Lef1 protein function and increased Wnt signaling. Mechanistically, Smad4 mutant proteins retained binding to Lef1 protein and drove a commensurate increase in downstream Wnt signaling as measured by TOP/FOP luciferase assay and Wnt-dependent cell motility. Consistent with these findings, human colorectal cancers with SMAD4 missense mutations were less likely to acquire activating mutations in the key Wnt pathway gene CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin) than colorectal cancers with truncating SMAD4 nonsense mutations. Implications: Our studies suggest that in colorectal cancer hotspot mutations in Smad4 confer enhanced Wnt signaling and possibly heightened sensitivity to Wnt pathway inhibitors."

Previous reports have suggested that the broad H3K4me3 domain can be considered as an epigenetic signature for tumor-suppressor genes in human cells. G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a new membrane-bound estrogen receptor, acts as an inhibitor on cell growth via epigenetic regulation in breast and ovarian cancer cells. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship of GPER and H3K4me3 in ovarian cancer tissue samples as well as in two different cell lines (Caov3 and Caov4). Silencing of GPER by a specific siRNA and two selective regulators with agonistic (G1) and antagonistic (G15) activity were applied for consecutive in vitro studies to investigate their impacts on tumor cell growth and the changes in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and H3K4me3. We found a positive correlation between GPER and H3K4me3 expression in ovarian cancer patients. Patients overexpressing GPER as well as H3K4me3 had significantly improved overall survival. Increased H3K4me3 and p-ERK1/2 levels and attenuated cell proliferation and migration were observed in Caov3 and Caov4 cells via activation of GPER by G1. Conversely, antagonizing GPER activity by G15 resulted in opposite effects in the Caov4 cell line. In conclusion, interaction of GPER and H3K4me3 appears to be of prognostic significance for ovarian cancer patients. The results of the in vitro analyses confirm the biological rationale for their interplay and identify GPER agonists, such as G1, as a potential therapeutic approach for future investigations."

A key function of HSPGs is their ability to modulate the expression and function of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, morphogens, and adhesion molecules. This is due to their capacity to act as ligands or co-receptors for various signal-transducing receptors, affecting pathways such as FGF, VEGF, chemokines, integrins, Wnt, notch, IL-6/JAK-STAT3, and NF kappa B. The activation of those pathways has been implicated in the induction, progression, and malignancy of a tumor. For many years, the study of signaling has allowed for designing specific drugs targeting these pathways for cancer treatment, with very positive results. Likewise, HSPGs have become the subject of cancer research and are increasingly recognized as important therapeutic targets. Although they have been studied in a variety of preclinical and experimental models, their mechanism of action in malignancy still needs to be more clearly defined. In this review, we discuss the role of cell-surface HSPGs as pleiotropic modulators of signaling in cancer and identify them as promising markers and targets for cancer treatment."

The present study aims to evaluate the anticancer activity of sumac (Rhus coriaria) against different human cancer MCF-7, PC-3, and SKOV3 cell lines. In addition, the study tries to explore a prospective mechanism of action, assessment of in vitro enzyme-inhibitory capacity of sumac extract against hCA I, II, IX, and XII. In the present study, the potential antitumor effects of sumac (Rhus coriaria) were explored in the human cancer cell lines; MCF-7, PC-3, and SKOV3 using in vitro assays. Apoptotic, cell survival, ELISA immunoassays were also conducted to reveal the inhibitory effects of sumac extract against hCA I, II, IX, and XII. In addition, both Clioquinol and Acetazolamide (AZM) were used as standards to explore the in vitro enzyme-inhibitory capacity of sumac extract against hCA I, II, IX, and XII. The hydro-alcoholic extract of R. coriaria (Sumac) was subjected to phytochemical analysis using GC/MS assays. Sumac at non-cytotoxic doses of 50 and 100 mu M significantly modulates the growth of the MCF-7, PC-3, and SKOV3 cancer cells with a higher inhibitory effect and selectivity to carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms; hCA I, II, hCA IX, and XII. The data showed that sumac at doses of 50 and 100 mu M significantly inhibited the growth, proliferation, and viability of cancer cells by activating the apoptotic process via caspase-3 overexpression and the regulation of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein."

Existing reports suggest that CXCR4 is frequently expressed by malignant tumor and is imperative for vascularization, tumor growth, cell migration, and metastasis pertaining to poor prognosis. In this study, we infer that CXCR4 confers resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Further, on the basis of colony forming ability, one finds that drug-resistant A549/GR cells with improved CXCR4 expression exhibited more resistance to IR than A549 cells evidenced along with a reduction in the formation of gamma -H2AX foci after IR. Transfection of shRNA against CXCR4 or treatment of pharmacological inhibitor (AMD3100) both led to sensitization of A549/GR cells towards IR. Conversely, the overexpression of CXCR4 in A549 and H460 cell lines was found to improve clonogenic survival, and reduce the formation of gamma -H2AX foci after IR. CXCR4 expression was further correlated with STAT3 activation, and suppression of STAT3 activity with siSTAT3 or a specific inhibitor (WP1066) significantly stymied the colony-forming ability and increased gamma -H2AX foci formation in A549/GR cells, indicating that CXCR4-mediated STAT3 signaling plays an important role for IR resistance in NSCLC cells. Finally, CXCR4/STAT3 signaling was mediated with the upregulation of Slug and downregulation of the same with siRNA, which heightened IR sensitivity in NSCLC cells. Our data collectively suggests that CXCR4/STAT3/Slug axis is paramount for IR resistance of NSCLC cells, and can be regarded as a therapeutic target to enhance the IR sensitivity of this devastating cancer."

Both talazoparib and olaparib are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating BRCA (breast cancer 1, early onset)-mutated HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) negative metastatic or advanced breast cancer. However, the optimal choice of first-line treatment has not been determined. Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of single-agent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative metastatic or advanced breast cancer. Results: We included two trials comprising 733 participants. Compared with talazoparib, olaparib was not associated with improved PFS (HR = 1.08, 95% CrI = 0.34-3.45) or OS (HR = 1.18, 95% CrI = 0.61-2.31). Compared with talazoparib, olaparib was associated with non-significantly improved ORR (OR = 0.83, 95% CrI= 0.05-12.64). Regarding safety, olaparib had reduced risk for both grade 3-4 anemia (OR = 0.34, 95% CrI= 0.003- 34.94) and any-grade anemia (OR = 0.37, 95% CrI= 0.02-6.81) compared with talazoparib. Olaparib also showed a low risk for grade 3-4 neutropenia (OR = 0.57, 95% CrI = 0.06-5.75) compared with talazoparib. Both talazoparib and olaparib were not associated with high risk of treatment discontinuation (OR = 0.95, 95% CrI= 0.21-4.47). Regarding time to QoL deterioration, olaparib was associated with short time to clinically meaningful QoL deterioration (HR = 1.16, 95% CrI= 0.19-7.17) compared to talazoparib. Conclusion: Both talazoparib and olaparib have similar efficacy, safety, and acceptability in patients with BRCAmutated HER2-negative metastatic or advanced breast cancer. Well-designed head-to-head randomized controlled trials with large samples are suggested to determine the optimal treatment choice. Methods: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We performed a systematic search of Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and international registers for published and unpublished double-blind randomized controlled trials from database inception to July 20, 2019. The pooled estimates of hazard ratios (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were calculated for PFS, OS, and the time to deterioration of quality of life (QoL). The pooled estimates of odds ratio (OR) with 95% CrIs were calculated for ORR, AEs, and treatment discontinuation. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019138939)."

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1), a member of the ALDH1 family, serves as a biomarker for cancer stem cells. We hypothesized that ALDH1B1 expression is associated with colorectal tumors. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect ALDH1B1 expression across a commercial colorectal tissue microarray. The signal intensities of the positively stained tissues were expressed using the mean integrated optical density (mean IOD). We also analyzed ALDH1B1 mRNA expression in the Oncomine database. The associations between ALDH1B1 expression and CRC stage and prognosis were then evaluated using the web-based tools, GEPIA and UALCAN. Analysis of the tissue microarray revealed that the expression of ALDH1B1 was significantly higher in colorectal adenomas and colorectal adenocarcinoma (IOD/area values = 0.117 +/- 0.070 and 0.168 +/- 0.0168, respectively) compared with normal and cancer-adjacent tissues (IOD/area values = 0.051 +/- 0.028 and 0.068 +/- 0.053). For samples collected in the hospital, ALDH1B1 was highly expressed in the adenoma (IOD/area = 0.103 +/- 0.054) and CRC (IOD/area = 0.116 +/- 0.059) tissues compared with the cancer-adjacent tissues (IOD/area = 0.066 +/- 0.024, p<0.05). The expression of ALDH1B1 in tissues from two resources was not found to be significantly associated with CRC stage. In Oncomine, ALDH1B1 mRNA expression was increased in the colorectal tumor tissues compared with the normal colorectal tissues (p=0.024) and its expression was independent of CRC stage and prognosis (p<0.05). Thus, while the protein and mRNA expression of ALDH1B1 suggests that it is a potential marker of colorectal tumors, its expression is independent of CRC stage and prognosis."

CAR-T cell is a good reason for optimism	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY			English	Review						Multiple myeloma; Adoptive cell therapy; CAR-T cells; Hematological malignancy		"Despite many recent advances on cancer novel therapies, researchers have yet a long way to cure cancer. They have to deal with tough challenges before they can reach success. Nonetheless, it seems that recently developed immunotherapy-based therapy approaches such as adoptive cell transfer (ACT) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy against various kinds of tumors even the cancers in the blood (liquid cancers). The hematological (liquid) cancers are hard to be targeted by usual cancer therapies, for they do not form localized solid tumors. Until recently, two types of ACTs have been developed and introduced; tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells which the latter is the subject of our discussion. It is interesting about engineered CAR-T cells that they are genetically endowed with unique cancer-specific characteristics, so they can use the potency of the host immune system to fight against either solid or liquid cancers. Multiple myeloma (MM) or simply referred to as myeloma is a type of hematological malignancy that affects the plasma cells. The cancerous plasma cells produce immunoglobulins (antibodies) uncontrollably which consequently damage the tissues and organs and break the immune system function. Although the last few years have seen significant progressions in the treatment of MM, still a complete remission remains unconvincing. MM is a medically challenging and stubborn disease with a disappointingly low rate of survival rate. When comparing the three most occurring blood cancers (i.e., lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma), myeloma has the lowest 5-year survival rate (around 40%). A low survival rate indicates a high mortality rate with difficulty in treatment. Therefore, novel CAR-T cell-based therapies or combination therapies along with CAT-T cells may bring new hope for multiple myeloma patients. CAR-T cell therapy has a high potential to improve the remission success rate in patients with MM. To date, many preclinical and clinical trial studies have been conducted to investigate the ability and capacity of CAR T cells in targeting the antigens on myeloma cells. Despite the problems and obstacles, CAR-T cell experiments in MM patients revealed a robust therapeutic potential. However, several factors might be considered during CAR-T cell therapy for better response and reduced side effects. Also, incorporating the CAT-T cell method into a combinational treatment schedule may be a promising approach. In this paper, with a greater emphasis on CAR-T cell application in the treatment of MM, we will discuss and introduce CAR-T cell's history and functions, their limitations, and the solutions to defeat the limitations and different types of modifications on CAR-T cells."

Therefore, treatment strategies have turned to targeting CSCs, and utilizing nanotechnological approaches to target CSCs has become increasingly fascinating. Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs), such as metallic NPs, liposomes, polymeric NPs, albumin microspheres and nanomicelles, can easily cross the cytoplasmic membrane and accumulate at their targets to continuously release therapeutic agents in response to the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. Different kinds of NPs possess different characteristics. Inducing immune responses might be the disadvantage they commonly owned through the summary and analysis of these NPs. For natural polymers, they have many attractive properties, but deficiencies also exist such as poor water-solubility, high viscosity, high permeability, etc. The drug-encapsulated NPs launched in the market and those in the clinical trials exhibit a bright prospect in cancer targeted therapy. In addition, the application of nanodiagnostic techniques, such as nanocantilever and DNA microarray technology and early cancer detection has become an indispensable component in clinical practice to improve in vivo detection and enhance targeting efficiency. This review mainly determines the species and usages of NPs in drug delivery and disease diagnosis, the delivery mechanisms of NPs, the main factors that affect nanomedicine efficiency and toxicity and the further trends in the development of targeted therapy. Nevertheless, more and deeper investigations are still needed to avert potential adverse effects and improve the delivery efficiency to achieve better therapeutic effects."

Pan-cancer profiling studies showed that RRM2, the small subunit M2 of RR, is abnormally overexpressed in multiple types of cancers; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms in cancers are still unclear. In this study, through searching in cancer-omics databases and immunohistochemistry validation with clinical samples, we showed that the expression of MYBL2, a key oncogenic transcriptional factor, was significantly upregulated correlatively with RRM2 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Ectopic expression and knockdown experiments indicated that MYBL2 was essential for CRC cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle progression in an RRM2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MYBL2 directly bound to the promoter of RRM2 gene and promoted its transcription during S-phase together with TAF15 and MuvB components. Notably, knockdown of MYBL2 sensitized CRC cells to treatment with MK-1775, a clinical trial drug for inhibition of WEE1, which is involved in a degradation pathway of RRM2. Finally, mouse xenograft experiments showed that the combined suppression of MYBL2 and WEE1 synergistically inhibited CRC growth with a low systemic toxicity in vivo. Therefore, we propose a new regulatory mechanism for RRM2 transcription for CRC proliferation, in which MYBL2 functions by constituting a dynamic S-phase transcription complex following the G1/early S-phase E2Fs complex. Doubly targeting the transcription and degradation machines of RRM2 could produce a synthetic inhibitory effect on RRM2 level with a novel potential for CRC treatment."

In the present study, we aim to identify miRNAs whose expression change in a tumor stage- and/or grade-dependent manner in serous OC. Computational analysis was performed in R using The Cancer Genome Atlas miRNA dataset. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed to compare the survival of patients with low and high expressions of identified miRNAs. We found that 91 and 90 miRNAs out of 799 are differentially expressed in terms of tumor stage and grade, respectively. miR-152, miR-375 and miR-204 were top three hits in terms of tumor stage; and similarly, miR-125b, miR-768-5p and -3p in terms of tumor grade. Among top 15 miRNAs whose expression most significantly changed between tumor stages, 66.7% were upregulated in late stage. However, 53.3% of top 15 miRNAs identified in terms of tumor grade were upregulated in high grade. 11 miRNAs are differentially expressed in terms of both tumor stage and grade. Expression changes of some of the top miRNAs were found to be associated with shorter survival in serous OC. Text mining analysis showed that most of these miRNAs have not been previously studied in the context of OC. Mechanistic studies of these miRNAs in OC progression, differentiation and metastasis will be of high importance to develop novel strategies for the treatment of serous ovarian cancer."

GRP78 dual effect in tumor growth and angiogenesis could be activated under VEGF stimulation. The current study was designed to investigate the inhibitory impact of sFLT01 protein on VEGF/GRP78 axis. To this point, sFLT01 construct was synthesized, recombinant plasmid was expressed in eukaryotic host cells, sFLT01-HisTag protein was extracted and analyzed. The functional activity of sFLT01 on VEGF-enhanced tube formation and angiogenesis of HUVEC cells were examined. Eventually, the inhibitory impact of sFLT01 on growth, invasiveness, and migration of human prostate cancer cell line, DU145, was assessed. Real-time PCR evaluated the level of GRP78 and its effect on the downstream factors; matrix metallopeptidase proteins 2&9 (MMP2&9) along with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase proteins1&2 (TIMP1&2) under sFLT01 stimulation. Results According to the data, sFLT01 protein showed modulatory impact on proliferation, invasion, and migration of DU145 cells along with the potential of HUVECs angiogenesis. Real-Time PCR analysis depicted a significant downregulation in GRP78, MMP2 and MMP9 transcripts' levels, and a subsequent elevation of TIMP1 and TIMP2 expression under sFLT01 stimulation was detected. Conclusion Overall, these data indicated that the inhibitory impact of sFLT01 on cancer cells growth and invasiveness could be mediated through the modulation of VEGF/GRP78/MMP2&9 axis and activation of TIMPs."

Moreover, a different molecular profile for HPV-related OPSCC has been described, opening new promising targeted therapies and immunotherapy approaches. Epigenetic and microbiome-based exploration of biomarkers has gained growing interest with a view to the primary oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) screening. Understanding the role of the epigenetic mechanism and the changes that occur during pathogenesis shows appreciable progress in recent years. The different methylation status of DNA and miRNAs demonstrates the value of possible biomarkers discriminating even in different stages of dysplasia. Through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) hold the key to recover missing information. O n the other hand, the microbiota investigation signifies a new biomarker approach for the evaluation of OPC. Along with known cofactors playing a major role in microbiota differentiation, HPV-related cases must be explored further for better understanding. The dynamic approach of the shotgun metagenomic sequencing will robustly fill the gap especially in species/strain level and consequently to biomarker detection. The constantly growing incidence of HPV-related OPC should lead us in further investigation and understanding of the unique features of the disease, more accurate diagnostic methods, along with the development and implementation of new, targeted therapies. This paper comprehensively reviews the significance of biomarkers based on epigenetics and microbiome profile in the accuracy of the diagnosis of the HPV-related cancer in the oropharynx."

The ectoenzyme CD73, encoded by the NT5E gene, which catalyses the hydrolysis of AMP into adenosine, has been associated to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, tumour cell adhesion and migration. Therefore, we investigated the expression and activity of CD73 in sphere-forming cells from cervical cancer in comparison to monolayer cells in vitro. In addition, in silico analysis was performed to determine the expression of CD73 and other members of purinergic signalling in CSC-like population derived from different tumour types in comparison to monolayer cells. CD73 protein expression levels and functionality in SiHa cells were analysed by flow cytometry and enzymatic assay, respectively. In silico investigation was performed through the analysis of seven datasets from different tumour types using GEO database. In vitro analysis showed a decreased CD73 protein expression and enzymatic activity in cervical spheres, when compared to monolayers. In addition, when sphere-derived cells are re-plated as monolayer culture, the CD73 expression and activity are restored. Supporting the in vitro results, in silico analysis showed that three-dimensional spheres derived from cervical, thyroid and breast cancer presented decreased expression of CD73, when compared to their adherent counterparts. The decreased expression of CD73 in sphere-derived cells or CSC-enriched population reinforce its important role in cell adhesion, tumour spreading ability and metastasis, suggesting CD73 as potential target to be further investigated in cervical cancer."

However, blockade of CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis by inhibitors like Nox-A12, FDA approved CXCR4 inhibitor drug AMD3100 have shown limited clinical success in cancer treatment. Therefore, exclusive contribution of CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling in pro-tumorigenic function is questionable. In our pursuit to understand the impact of chemokine signaling in carcinogenesis, we reveal that instead of CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling, presence of CXCR4 intracellular protein augments paclitaxel resistance and pro-tumorigenic functions. In search of pro-apoptotic mechanisms for CXCR4 mediated drug resistance; we discover that DR5 is a new selective target of CXCR4 in breast and colon cancer. Further, we detect that CXCR4 directs the differential recruitment of transcription factors p53 and YY1 to the promoter of DR5 in course of its transcriptional repression. Remarkably, inhibiting CXCR4-ligand-mediated signals completely fails to block the above phenotype. Overexpression of different mutant versions of CXCR4 lacking signal transduction capabilities also result in marked downregulation of DR5 expression in colon cancer indeed confirms the reverse relationship between DR5 and intracellular CXCR4 protein expression. Irrespective of CXCR4 surface expression, by utilizing stable gain and loss of function approaches, we observe that intracellular CXCR4 protein selectively resists and sensitizes colon cancer cells against paclitaxel therapy in vitro and in vivo. Finally, performing TCGA data mining and using human breast cancer patient samples, we demonstrate that expression of CXCR4 and DR5 are inversely regulated. Together, our data suggest that targeting CXCR4 intracellular protein may be critical to dampen the pro-tumorigenic functions of CXCR4."

Immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves pathological complete response in breast cancer. To understand why only a subset of tumors respond to ICB, patients with hormone receptor-positive or triple-negative breast cancer were treated with anti-PD1 before surgery. Paired pre- versus on-treatment biopsies from treatment-naive patients receiving anti-PD1 (n = 29) or patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy before anti-PD1 (n = 11) were subjected to single-cell transcriptome, T cell receptor and proteome profiling. One-third of tumors contained PD1-expressing T cells, which clonally expanded upon anti-PD1 treatment, irrespective of tumor subtype. Expansion mainly involved CD8(+) T cells with pronounced expression of cytotoxic-activity (PRF1, GZMB), immune-cell homing (CXCL13) and exhaustion markers (HAVCR2, LAG3), and CD4(+) T cells characterized by expression of T-helper-1 (IFNG) and follicular-helper (BCL6, CXCR5) markers. In pre-treatment biopsies, the relative frequency of immunoregulatory dendritic cells (PD-L1(+)), specific macrophage phenotypes (CCR2(+) or MMP9(+)) and cancer cells exhibiting major histocompatibility complex class I/II expression correlated positively with T cell expansion. Conversely, undifferentiated pre-effector/memory T cells (TCF7(+), GZMK(+)) or inhibitory macrophages (CX3CR1(+), C3(+)) were inversely correlated with T cell expansion.

However, the specific signature of CAFs and their related clinicopathological parameters in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain unclear. Here, methods to recognize gene signatures were employed to roughly assess the infiltration of CAFs in RCC, based on the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to cluster transcriptomes and correlate with CAFs to identify the gene signature. Single-cell and cell line sequencing data were used to verify the expression specificity of the gene signature in CAFs. The gene signature was used to evaluate the infiltration of CAFs in each sample, and the clinical significance of each key gene in the gene signature and CAFs was analyzed. We observed that the CAF infiltration was higher in kidney cancer and advanced tumor stage and grade than in normal tissues. The seven key genes of the CAF gene signature identified using WGCNA showed high expression of CAF-related characteristics in the cell clustering landscape and fibroblast cell lines; these genes were found to be associated with extracellular matrix function, collagen synthesis, cell surface interaction, and adhesion. The high CAF infiltration and the key genes were verified from the TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus data related to the advanced grade, advanced stage, and poor prognosis of RCC. In summary, our findings indicate that the clinically significant gene signature may serve as a potential biomarker of CAFs in RCC, and the infiltration of CAFs is associated with the pathological grade, stage, and prognosis of RCC."

AP-2 alpha Regulates S-Phase and Is a Marker for Sensitivity to PI3K Inhibitor Buparlisib in Colon Cancer	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AP-2; TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE; ADJUVANT TREATMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; FLUOROURACIL; CELLS; CHEMOTHERAPY; OXALIPLATIN; COMBINATION; LEUCOVORIN	"Activating protein 2 alpha (AP-2 alpha; encoded by TFAP2A) functions as a tumor suppressor and influences response to therapy in several cancer types. We aimed to characterize regulation of the transcriptome by AP-2 alpha in colon cancer. CRISPR-Cas9 and short hairpin RNA were used to eliminate TFAP2A expression in HCT116 and a panel of colon cancer cell lines. AP-2 alpha target genes were identified with RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Effects on cell cycle were characterized in cells synchronized with aphidicolin and analyzed by FACS and Premo FUCCI. Effects on invasion and tumorigenesis were determined by invasion assay, growth of xenografts, and phosphorylated histone H3 (PHH3). Knockout of TFAP2A induced significant alterations in the transcriptome including repression of TGM2, identified as a primary gene target of AP-2 alpha. Loss of AP-2 alpha delayed progression through S-phase into G(2)-M and decreased phosphorylation of AKT, effects that were mediated through regulation of TGM2. Buparlisib (BKM120) repressed in vitro invasiveness of HCT116 and a panel of colon cancer cell lines; however, loss of AP-2 alpha induced resistance to buparlisib. Similarly, buparlisib repressed PHH3 and growth of tumor xenografts and increased overall survival of tumor-bearing mice, whereas, loss of AP-2 alpha induced resistance to the effect of PI3K inhibition. Loss of AP-2 alpha in colon cancer leads to prolonged S-phase through altered activation of AKT leading to resistance to the PI3K inhibitor, Buparlisib. The findings demonstrate an important role for AP-2 alpha in regulating progression through the cell cycle and indicates that AP-2 alpha is a marker for response to PI3K inhibitors."

The immune score is currently used to assess prognosis and to guide immunotherapy; however, its association with lung cancer prognosis is not clear. Methods: Clinical features and immune score data of lung cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas were obtained to build a clinical prognosis nomogram. The model's accuracy was verified by calibration curves. Results: In total, 1005 patients with lung cancer were included. Patients were divided into three groups according to low, medium, and high immune scores. Compared with patients in the low immune score group, the disease-free survival (DFS) of patients in medium and high immune score groups was significantly longer; the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were 0.77 [0.60-0.99] and 0.74 [0.60-0.91], respectively. The overall survival (OS) of patients in the medium and high immune score groups was significantly longer than in the low immune score group; the HR and 95% CI were 0.74 [0.57-0.96] and 0.69 [0.55-0.88], respectively. A clinical prediction model was established to predict the survival prognosis. As verified by calibration curves, the model showed good predictive ability, especially for predicting 3-/5-year DFS and OS. Conclusion: Patients with lung cancer with medium and high immune scores had longer DFS and OS than those in low immune score group. Patient prognosis can be effectively predicted by the clinical prediction model combining clinical features and immune score and was consistent with actual clinical outcomes."

Despite advances in immunotherapy, the inability to specifically eradicate CSCs has led to treatment failure. Hence, identification of appropriate antigen sources is a major challenge in designing dendritic cell (DC)-based therapeutic strategies against CSCs. Here, in an in vitro model using the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, we explored the efficacy of DCs loaded with exosomes derived from CSC-enriched colonospheres (CSCenr-EXOs) as an antigen source in activating CSC-specific T-cell responses. HT-29 lysate, HT-29-EXOs and CSCenr lysate were independently assessed as separate antigen sources. Having confirmed CSCs enrichment in spheroids, CSCenr-EXOs were purified and characterized, and their impact on DC maturation was investigated. Finally, the impact of the antigen-pulsed DCs on the proliferation rate and also spheroid destructive capacity of autologous T cells was assessed. CSCenr-EXOs similar to other antigen groups had no suppressive/negative impacts on phenotypic maturation of DCs as judged by the expression level of costimulatory molecules. Notably, similar to CSCenr lysate, CSCenr-EXOs significantly increased the IL-12/IL-10 ratio in supernatants of mature DCs. CSCenr-EXO-loaded DCs effectively promoted T-cell proliferation. Importantly, T cells stimulated with CSCenr-EXOs disrupted spheroids' structure. Thus, CSCenr-EXOs present a novel and promising antigen source that in combination with conventional tumour bulk-derived antigens should be further explored in pre-clinical immunotherapeutic settings for the efficacy in hampering recurrence and metastatic spread."

Transglutaminase 2 promotes tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells by inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53	ONCOGENE			English	Article							TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE; TP53 MUTATION; STEM-CELLS; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; TG2; ADJUVANT; INVASION; DISEASE	"Despite a high clinical need for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, targeted therapies are still limited. The multifunctional enzyme Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), which harbors transamidation and GTPase activity, has been implicated in the development and progression of different types of human cancers. However, the mechanism and role of TGM2 in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here, we present TGM2 as a promising drug target. In primary patient material of CRC patients, we detected an increased expression and enzymatic activity of TGM2 in colon cancer tissue in comparison to matched normal colon mucosa cells. The genetic ablation of TGM2 in CRC cell lines using shRNAs or CRISPR/Cas9 inhibited cell expansion and tumorsphere formation. In vivo, tumor initiation and growth were reduced upon genetic knockdown of TGM2 in xenotransplantations. TGM2 ablation led to the induction of Caspase-3-driven apoptosis in CRC cells. Functional rescue experiments with TGM2 variants revealed that the transamidation activity is critical for the pro-survival function of TGM2. Transcriptomic and protein-protein interaction analyses applying various methods including super-resolution and time-lapse microscopy showed that TGM2 directly binds to the tumor suppressor p53, leading to its inactivation and escape of apoptosis induction. We demonstrate here that TGM2 is an essential survival factor in CRC, highlighting the therapeutic potential of TGM2 inhibitors in CRC patients with high TGM2 expression. The inactivation of p53 by TGM2 binding indicates a general anti-apoptotic function, which may be relevant in cancers beyond CRC."

Based on available experimental data, the performance of AutoDock4.2.6 software was first validated to predict the inhibitor-ABCG2 binding mode and affinity. Combined molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations, were then performed to filter out the studied drug candidates. From the estimated docking scores and MM-GBSA binding energies, six auspicious drug candidates-namely, pibrentasvir, venetoclax, ledipasvir, avatrombopag, cobicistat, and revefenacin-exhibited auspicious binding energies with value < -70.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, pibrentasvir, venetoclax, and ledipasvir were observed to show even higher binding affinities with the ABCG2 transporter with binding energies of < -80.0 kcal/mol over long MD simulations of 100 ns. The stabilities of these three promising candidates in complex with ABCG2 transporter were demonstrated by their energetics and structural analyses throughout the 100 ns MD simulations. The current study throws new light on pibrentasvir, venetoclax, and ledipasvir as curative options for multidrug resistant cancers by inhibiting ABCG2 transporter."	"[Ibrahim, Mahmoud A.

Dendritic cell targeting with Fc-enhanced CD40 antibody agonists induces durable antitumor immunity in humanized mouse models of bladder cancer	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CLINICAL-TRIAL DESIGN; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; GAMMA-RIIB; T-CELLS; PHASE-I; IMMUNOTHERAPY; INNATE; ACTIVATION; ENGAGEMENT; MELANOMA	"Intravesical immunotherapy using Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) attenuated bacteria delivered transurethrally to the bladder has been the standard of care for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) for several decades. BCG therapy continues to be limited by high rates of disease recurrence and progression, and patients with BCG-unresponsive disease have few effective salvage therapy options besides radical cystectomy, highlighting a need for new therapies. We report that the immune-stimulatory receptor CD40 is highly expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) within the bladder tumor microenvironment of orthotopic bladder cancer mouse models, recapitulating CD40 expression by DCs found in human disease. We demonstrate that local CD40 agonism in mice with orthotopic bladder cancer through intravesical delivery of anti-CD40 agonist antibodies drives potent antitumor immunity and induces pharmacodynamic effects in the bladder tumor microenvironment, including a reduction in CD8(+) T cells with an exhausted phenotype. We further show that type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1) and CD8(+) T cells are required for both bladder cancer immune surveillance and anti-CD40 agonist antibody responses. Using orthotopic murine models humanized for CD40 and Fc. receptors, we demonstrate that intravesical treatment with a fully human, Fc-enhanced anti-CD40 agonist antibody (2141-V11) induces robust antitumor activity in both treatment-naive and treatment-refractory settings, driving long-term systemic antitumor immunity with no evidence of systemic toxicity. These findings support targeting CD40-expressing DCs in the bladder cancer microenvironment through an intravesical agonistic antibody approach for the treatment of NMIBC."

CSCs have unique capabilities to resist anticancer therapy, seed recurrent tumors, and disseminate to and colonize distant tissues. Apatinib, a small-molecule VEGFR2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, shows highly efficient antitumor activity in heavily treated, chemoresistant, and metastatic lung cancer. We speculated that inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and targeting lung CSCs could be one of the anti-tumor mechanisms of apatinib. In the present study we demonstrated that apatinib repressed lung CSC-like traits by hindering sphere formation ability, lung CSC-related marker expression and decreasing chemoresistance derived stemness. Mechanistically, apatinib exerted its anti-CSC effects by inhibiting beta-catenin and its downstream targets. Moreover, apatinib induced the production of reactive oxyen species (ROS), which participated in the inhibitory effects of apatinib on lung CSCs. It was found that beta-catenin regulated apatinib-induced production of ROS. Inhibition or promotion of ROS production with N-acetyl-L-cysteine or H2O2 not only upregulated or downregulated beta-catenin expression, but also prevented or promoted DNA damage, rescued or impeded sphere formation, respectively. Collectively, our findings reveal that apatinib directly inhibits beta-catenin signaling and promotes ROS generation to suppress lung CSC-like characteristics. A clearer understanding of the anti-cancer mechanisms of apatinib is required for its better application in combating advanced and refractory/recurrent lung cancer when combined with conventional chemotherapy."

This process is critical for cancer cells to adapt to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment resulting from rapid tumor growth. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor and a master regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia. The activity of HIF-1 is dictated primarily by its alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha), whose level and/or activity are largely regulated by an oxygen-dependent and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated process. Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Von Hippel-Lindau factor (VHL) catalyze hydroxylation and subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HIF-1 alpha by the proteasome. Seven in Absentia Homolog 2 (SIAH2), a RING finger-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, stabilizes HIF-1 alpha by targeting PHDs for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the proteasome. This SIAH2-HIF-1 signaling axis is important for maintaining the level of HIF-1 alpha under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. A number of protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate SIAH2, thereby regulating its stability, activity, or substrate binding. In this review, we will discuss the regulation of the SIAH2-HIF-1 axis via phosphorylation of SIAH2 by these kinases and the potential implication of this regulation in cancer biology and cancer therapy."

The prognosis and clinical outcomes of cancer immunotherapy in melanoma patients are influenced by immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the expression of genetic factors.

In this study, we established verified a 7-gene prognostic signature. Melanoma patients from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were separated into a low-risk group and a high-risk group using the median risk score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for overall survival (OS) showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.701 for 1 year, 0.726 for 3 years, and 0.745 for 5 years, respectively.

SPRY4 has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor gene in various tumors. This study aims to assess the role of SPRY4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and uncover its underlying mechanisms. Firstly, the expression levels of SPRY4 were measured in CRC cell lines. SPRY4-overexpressing or silencing plasmids were transfected into CRC cells to regulate its expression level. CCK-8, colony formation, EdU assay, wound-healing and Transwell assays were performed to determine cell proliferation, invasion and migration abilities. Then, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry analysis, and the expression of apoptosis-related protein was analyzed by western-blotting. Next, the in vivo tumorigenesis assay was performed in nude mice. According to the results, there was a lower expression of SPRY4 in CRC cell lines compared with normal cell line, and the overexpression of SPRY4 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis in SW480 cells. Moreover, the enhanced proliferation, invasion and migration upon SPRY4 silencing was reversed by EZH2 inhibition. In addition, we found that the overexpression of SPRY4 inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo by diminishing the size and weight of the tumors. Our study indicates that SPRY4 might be a potential tumor suppressor gene and prognostic factor for patients with CRC."

Methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (Mars2) has been suggested as a biomarker indicating poor prognosis of cancers. This study focuses on the function of Mars2 in GC and the responsible molecules. Mars2 was highly expressed in GC patients according to a transcriptome analysis and the data from the public database, and its high expression was confirmed in the acquired GC cell lines. Downregulation of Mars2 significantly weakened the proliferation, resistance to death, migration and invasion of GC cells. The H3K4me3 modification level was increased in the promoter region of Mars2, which was attributed to reduced abundance of lysine demethylase 5D (KDM5D) in the Mars2 promoter. MicroRNA (miR)-4661-5p was identified as an upstream regulator of KDM5D. Downregulation of miR-4661-5p led to an increase in the expression of KDM5D while a decline in the expression of Mars2, which reduced the malignant behaviors of GC cells; however, the malignant behaviors of GC cells was restored after further inhibition of KDM5D. To conclude, this study suggested that increased Mars2 expression upon miR-4661-5p-mediated KDM5D downregulation is correlated with malignant degree of GC cells."

CCL18-dependent migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of oral squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic ductal carcinoma and bladder cancer cells are well-established. In the tumor niche, tumor-associated macrophages produce CCL18 and its overexpression is correlated with reduced patient survival in multiple cancers. Although multiple receptors including C-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CCR3), type 6 (CCR6), type 8 (CCR8) and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) are reported for CCL18, the Phosphatidylinositol Transfer Protein, Membrane-Associated 3 (PITPNM3) receptor is currently considered as its predominant receptor. Characterization of the molecular events and check points associated with the immunosuppressive and cancer progression support functions induced by CCL18 for their potential towards therapeutic applications is an area of active research. Hence, in this study, we assembled 917 signaling events reported to be induced by CCL18 through their studied receptors in diverse cell types as an integrated knowledgebase for reference, data integration and gene-set enrichment analysis of global transcriptomic and/or proteomics datasets."

However, modifications in cancer cells surviving combined and sequential treatment still remain poorly described. In order to mimic clinical neoadjuvant treatment, we first treated MDA-MB-231 and SUM159-PT TNBC cell lines with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for 2 days, and then with paclitaxel for another 2 days. After 4 days of recovery, persistent cells surviving the treatment were characterized at both cellular and molecular level. Persistent cells exhibited increased growth and were more invasive in vitro and in zebrafish model. Persistent cells were enriched for vimentin(high) sub-population, vimentin knockdown using siRNA approach decreased the invasive and sphere forming capacities as well as Akt phosphorylation in persistent cells, indicating that vimentin is involved in chemotherapeutic treatment-induced enhancement of TNBC aggressiveness. Interestingly, ectopic vimentin overexpression in native cells increased cell invasion and sphere formation as well as Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, vimentin overexpression alone rendered the native cells resistant to the drugs, while vimentin knockdown rendered them more sensitive to the drugs. Together, our data suggest that vimentin could be considered as a new targetable player in the ever-elusive status of drug resistance and recurrence of TNBC."

However, their role in cancer metastasis has not been entirely understood. In this study, effects of oxidized phosphatidylcholines such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and autophagy were determined in cancer cells by immunoblotting and confocal analysis. Metastasis was analyzed by a scratch wound assay and a transwell migration/invasion assay. The concentrations of POVPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (PGPC) in tumor tissues obtained from patients were measured by LC-MS/MS analysis. POVPC induced EMT, resulting in increase of migration and invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and human breast cancer cells (MCF7). POVPC induced autophagic flux through AMPK-mTOR pathway. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of autophagy decreased migration and invasion of POVPC-treated HepG2 and MCF7 cells. POVPC and PGPC levels were greatly increased at stage II of patient-derived intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues. PGPC levels were higher in malignant breast tumor tissues than in adjacent nontumor tissues. The results show that oxidized phosphatidylcholines increase metastatic potential of cancer cells by promoting EMT, mediated through autophagy. These suggest the positive regulatory role of oxidized phospholipids accumulated in tumor microenvironment in the regulation of tumorigenesis and metastasis."

These benign lesions need to explore the morphology, histological diagnosis, and biomarkers profile to accurately characterize lesions with potential for evolution to cancer. This study aimed to correlate the immunohistochemical expression of Parkin and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC; tumor suppressors), Human Apurinic/Apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL; oncogenic proteins) in sporadic colorectal polyps with clinical, endoscopic, and diagnostic data. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue microarray samples of 306 polyps. Based on the Allred score, the expressions were graduated in the cytoplasm and nucleus of superficial and cryptic cells. There was higher Parkin nuclear expression (p=0.006 and 0.010) and APC cytoplasmic expression in cryptic cells (p<0.001) in SPs. CAs, APE1 (p<0.001) and Bcl-xL (p<0.001) were more expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasms, respectively. These results are related to the biological role proposed for these proteins in cellular functions.

Cells allowed to recover acquire thermotolerance, but this adaptation is poorly understood. By quantitative proteomics, we discovered selective upregulation of HSP70-family chaperone HSPA1 and its co-factors, HSPH1 and DNAJB1, in MCF7 breast cancer cells acquiring thermotolerance. HSPA1 was found to have dual function during heat stress response: (i) During acute stress, it promotes the recruitment of the 26S proteasome to translating ribosomes, thus poising cells for rapid protein degradation and resumption of protein synthesis upon recovery; (ii) during thermotolerance, HSPA1 together with HSPH1 maintains ubiquitylated nascent/newly synthesized proteins in a soluble state required for their efficient proteasomal clearance. Consistently, deletion of HSPH1 impedes thermotolerance and esophageal tumor growth in mice, thus providing a potential explanation for the poor prognosis of digestive tract cancers with high HSPH1 and nominating HSPH1 as a cancer drug target. We propose dual roles of HSPA1 either alone or in complex with HSPH1 and DNAJB1 in promoting quality control of nascent/newly synthesized proteins and cellular thermotolerance."

Although the treatment of OSCC has improved recently, it still has a high rate of local recurrence and poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 50%. Advanced stage OSCC tends to metastasize to lymph nodes. Thus, exploring new therapeutic strategies for OSCC is therefore an urgent priority. Exosomes, the small membrane vesicles derived from endosomes, have been detected in a wide array of bodily fluids. Exosomes contain a diversity of proteins, mRNAs, and non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, piRNAs, circular RNAs, tsRNAs, and ribosomal RNAs, which are delivered to neighboring cells or even transported to distant sites. Exosomes have been associated with the tumorigenesis of OSCC, promote the proliferation, colonization, and metastasis of OSCC by transferring their contents to the target cells. Furthermore, exosomes are involved in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment to transform conditions favoring cancer progression in vivo. In this review, we summarize the crucial role of exosomes in the tumorigenesis and progression of OSCC and discuss the potential clinical application of exosomes in OSCC treatment."

MAP3K7 Loss Drives Enhanced Androgen Signaling and Independently Confers Risk of Recurrence in Prostate Cancer with Joint Loss of CHD1	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							CELL-CYCLE; IDENTIFICATION; ENZALUTAMIDE; MECHANISMS; RESISTANCE; DIAGNOSIS; GENOMICS; OUTCOMES; THERAPY	"Prostate cancer genomic subtypes that stratify aggressive disease and inform treatment decisions at the primary stage are currently limited. Previously, we functionally validated an aggressive subtype present in 15% of prostate cancer characterized by dual deletion of MAP3K7 and CHD1. Recent studies in the field have focused on deletion of CHD1 and its role in androgen receptor (AR) chromatin distribution and resistance to AR-targeted therapy; however, CHD1 is rarely lost without codeletion of MAP3K7. Here, we show that in the clinically relevant context of co-loss of MAP3K7 and CHD1 there are significant, collective changes to aspects of AR signaling. Although CHD1 loss mainly impacts the expansion of the AR cistrome, loss of MAP3K7 drives increased AR target gene expression. Prostate cancer cell line models engineered to cosuppress MAP3K7 and CHD1 also demonstrated increased AR-v7 expression and resistance to the AR-targeting drug enzalutamide. Furthermore, we determined that low protein expression of both genes is significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in a clinical cohort of radical prostatectomy specimens. Low MAP3K7 expression, however, was the strongest independent predictor for risk of BCR over all other tested clinicopathologic factors including CHD1 expression. Collectively, these findings illustrate the importance of MAP3K7 loss in a molecular subtype of prostate cancer that poses challenges to conventional therapeutic approaches."

It drives the formation of liquid-like condensates containing biomolecules in the absence of membrane structures in living cells. In addition, typical membrane-less condensates such as nuclear speckles, stress granules and cell signaling clusters play important roles in various cellular activities, including regulation of transcription, cellular stress response and signal transduction. Previous studies highlighted the biophysical and biochemical principles underlying the formation of these liquid condensates. The studies also showed how these principles determine the molecular properties, LLPS behavior, and composition of liquid condensates. While the basic rules driving LLPS are continuously being uncovered, their function in cellular activities is still unclear, especially within a pathological context. Therefore, the present review summarizes the recent progress made on the existing roles of LLPS in cancer, including cancer-related signaling pathways, transcription regulation and maintenance of genome stability. Additionally, the review briefly introduces the basic rules of LLPS, and cellular signaling that potentially plays a role in cancer, including pathways relevant to immune responses and autophagy."

The epidemiological investigation and animal and cell experiments show that EGCG has a preventive and therapeutic effect on many kinds of tumours. Here, colorectal cancer cells RKO and HCT116 were employed, and the CCK8 proliferation test was used to screen the appropriate concentration of EGCG and irinotecan, and the effects of single and/or combined drugs on migration, invasion, DNA damage, cell cycle and autophagy of tumour cells were investigated. The results showed that EGCG combined with irinotecan (0.5 mu mol L-) not only had a stronger inhibitory effect on tumour cells than EGCG or irinotecan alone but also prevented tumour cell migration and invasion. EGCG alone did not cause DNA damage in colorectal cancer cells, but its combination with irinotecan could induce S or G2 phase arrest by inhibiting topoisomerase I to cause more extensive DNA damage. EGCG also induced apoptosis by promoting autophagy with irinotecan synergistically.

Here we show that Maf1 is required for rapamycin to increase radio-sensitivity in A549 lung cancer cells. In response to ionizing radiation (IR), Maf1 is inhibited by Akt-dependent re-phosphorylation, which activates mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) through ATF5. Rapamycin suppresses IR-induced Maf1 re-phosphorylation and UPRmt activation in A549 cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to IR-mediated cytotoxicity. Consistently, Maf1 knockdown activates ATF5-transcription of mtHSP70 and HSP60, enhances mitochondrial membrane potential, reduces intracellular ROS levels and dampens rapamycin's effect on increasing IR-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, Maf1 overexpression suppresses ethidium bromide-induced UPRmt and enhances IR-mediated cytotoxicity. Supporting our cell-based studies, elevated expression of UPRmt makers (mtHSP70 and HSP60) are associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAUD). Together, our study reveals a novel role of Maf1-UPRmt axis in mediating rapamycin's enhancing effect on IR sensitivity in A549 lung cancer cells."

To investigate the role of long intergenic non-coding RNA LINC00485 in CRC, we performed in vitro functional experiments. LoVo tumor-bearing and liver metastasis mice were used as in vivo models. We found that LINC00485 expression was significantly lower in CRC tissues and cancer cells than in paired normal samples and human normal colonic epithelial cells. Lower expression of LINC00485 predicted poor prognosis in CRC patients. LINC00485 knockdown promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of FHC cells, while LINC00485 overexpression weakened these abilities of LoVo cells. MicroRNA miR-581 was the downstream target of LINC00485, which was downregulated in CRC samples and cancer cells compared to normal tissues and normal colonic epithelial cells. MiR-581 overexpression induced proliferation, migration, and invasion of FHC cells, while miR-581 antagomir treatment produced opposite results. MiR-581 directly targeted the 3'UTR of EDEM1 and inhibited its expression and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CRC. In mouse models, LINC00485 knockdown or down-regulation of miR-581 significantly repressed CRC cell growth and prevented CRC liver metastasis. Overall, LINC00485 suppressed CRC tumorigenesis and progression by targeting the miR-581/EDEM1 axis. LINC00485 may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC."

Mutations in the beta B2 crystallin gene or denaturation of beta B2-crystallin protein are associated with cataracts, ocular pathologies, and psychiatric disorders. A prominent role for beta B2-crystallins in axonal growth and regeneration, as well as in dendritic outgrowth, has been demonstrated after optic nerve injury. Studies in beta B2-crystallin-null mice revealed morphological and functional abnormalities in testis and ovaries, indicating beta B2-crystallin contributes to male and female fertility in mice. Interestingly, although pathogenic significance remains obscure, several studies identified a clear correlation between beta B2 crystallin expression and the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma in the African American population.

Clinical-pathological and experimental evidence indicates that MAGI1 expression is decreased in some inflammatory diseases, and also in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal, cervical, breast, brain, and gastric cancers and appears to act as a tumor suppressor, modulating the activity of oncogenic pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Genomic mutations and other mechanisms such as mechanical stress or inflammation have been described to regulate MAGI1 expression. Intriguingly, in breast and colorectal cancers, MAGI1 expression is induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), suggesting a role in mediating the tumor suppressive activity of NSAIDs. More recently, MAGI1 was found to localize at mature focal adhesion and to regulate integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling in endothelial cells. Here, we review MAGI1 ' s role as scaffolding protein, recent developments in the understanding of MAGI1 function as tumor suppressor gene, its role in endothelial cells and its implication in cancer and vascular biology.

In the present work, a Gastric Cancer specific lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network (GCsLMM) was constructed based on the ceRNA hypothesis by combining miRNA-target interactions and data on the expression of GC. To mine for novel prognostic signatures associated with GC, we performed topological analysis, a random walk with restart algorithm, in the GCsLMM from three levels, miRNA-, mRNA-, and lncRNA-levels. We further obtained candidate prognostic signatures by calculating the integrated score and analyzed the robustness of these signatures by combination strategy. The biological roles of key candidate signatures were also explored. Finally, we targeted the PHF10 gene and analyzed the expression patterns of PHF10 in independent datasets.

We used the CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing system to delete a short sequence encoding amino acids 400-411 in the DNA-binding domain (amino acid sequence: 317-567) from STAT3 gene in SW480, SW620 and HCT116 colon cancer cells. ChIP sequencing analysis showed that STAT3(del) occupancy was significantly reduced in 1029 genes and significantly increased in 475 genes compared to wild-type STAT3. The mutation altered the DNA motifs recognized by STAT3(del) as compared to the wild-type STAT3. We observed a strong correlation between expression of the STAT3 target genes and the loss or gain of STAT3(del) binding to their promoters.

Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), as a member of the pyrin-HIN family proteins, plays contentious roles in different types of cancers. In the present work, we provide evidence that AIM2 was commonly downregulated in human CRC and loss of AIM2 significantly correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastases) stage in patients suffering from CRC. AIM2 knockdown promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress, whereas AIM2 overexpression did the opposite. AIM2 inhibited glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1) expression through Smoothened homolog (SMO)-independent pathway and regulated CRC cell proliferation and migration in a Gli1-dependent manner. Moreover, AIM2 could modulate Protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and the increased Gli1 expression and EMT progress induced by AIM2 depletion was reversed after incubation with AKT inhibitor Ly294002 in CRC cells. In conclusion, our results define AIM2 as a novel regulator of Gli1 in CRC cell growth and metastasis, and suggest that the AIM2/AKT/mTOR/Gli1 signaling axis may serve as a potential target for treatment of CRC."

Using this evolutionarily conserved mechanism, cancer cells become drug-resistant and acquire the ability to escape the cytotoxic effect of anti-cancer drugs. In addition, these cells gain invasive features and increased mobility thereby promoting metastases. In this respect, the process of EMT is critical for dissemination of solid tumors including breast cancer. It has been shown that miRNAs are instrumental for the regulation of EMT, where they play both positive and negative roles often as a part of a feed-back loop. Recent studies have highlighted a novel association of p53 and EMT where the mutation status of p53 is critically important for the outcome of this process. Interestingly, p53 has been shown to mediate its effects via the miRNA-dependent mechanism that targets master-regulators of EMT, such as Zeb1/2, Snail, Slug, and Twist1. This regulation often involves interactions of miRNAs with lncRNAs. In this review, we present a detailed overview of miRNA/lncRNA-dependent mechanisms that control interplay between p53 and master-regulators of EMT and their importance for breast cancer."

The correlation between genetic alteration of C12orf75 and immune infiltration was investigated using the cBioPortal and TIMER databases. RNA interference was used to verify the influence of C12orf75 knockdown on the biological phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. C12orf75 showed increased expression in most tested human cancers. The increased expression of C12orf75 was related with a poor prognosis in urothelial bladder carcinoma and hepatocellular liver carcinoma, but it was surprisingly converse in renal papillary cell carcinoma. In urothelial bladder carcinoma and hepatocellular liver carcinoma, we observed positive correlations between the expression of C12orf75 and the infiltration of immune cells, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. The knockdown of C12orf75 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion and arrested the cell cycle.

Exosomes contribute to pathological processes of multiple cancers. Objective: In this study, we explored the function and mechanisms of exosomal miR-103a-3p derived from cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) in cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Results: MiR-103a-3p was highly expressed in CAF5 and CAF exosomes, and exosomal miR-103a-3p derived from CAF5 in NSCLC. CAF5 exosomes co-cultured with NSCLC cells promoted miR-103a-3p expression both in NSCLC cells and its exosomes. Functional experiments showed that exo-miR-103a-3p derived from CAF5 promoted cisplatin resistance and inhibited apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Pumilio2 (Pum2) bound with miR-103a-3p in cytoplasm and nucleus, and facilitated packaging into CAF-derived exosomes in NSCLC cells. Further analysis showed Bak1 was a direct target of miR-103a-3p, and miR-103a-3p accelerated cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells via Bak1 downregulation. In vivo tumorigenesis assay showed CAF-derived exosomal miR-103a-3p enhanced cisplatin resistance and inhibited cell apoptosis in NSCLC. Conclusion: Our study revealed that CAFs-derived exosomal miR-103a-3p promoted cisplatin resistance by suppressing apoptosis via targeting Bak1, which provided a potential therapeutic target for cisplatin resistance in NSCLC."

However, the exact role of ARLs in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. In this study, we systematically investigate the expression status, interactive relations, potential pathways, genetic variations and clinical values of ARLs in GC. We find that ARLs are significantly dysregulated in GC and involved in various cancer-related pathways. Subsequently, machine learning models identify ARL4C as one of the two most significant clinical indicators among ARLs for GC. Furthermore, ARL4C silencing remarkably inhibits the growth and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, enrichment analysis indicates that ARL4C is highly correlated with TGF-beta 1 signalling. Correspondingly, TGF-beta 1 treatment dramatically increases ARL4C expression and ARL4C knockdown inhibits the phosphorylation level of Smads, downstream factors of TGF-beta 1. Meanwhile, the coexpression of ARL4C and TGF-beta 1 worsens the prognosis of GC patients. Our work comprehensively demonstrates the crucial role of ARLs in the carcinogenesis of GC and the specific mechanisms underlying the GC-promoting effects of TGF-beta 1. More importantly, we uncover the great promise of ARL4C-targeted therapy in improving the efficacy of TGF-beta 1 inhibitors for GC patients."

Biologically active glucocorticoids that stimulate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) have an 11 beta-OH moiety, and resistant tumors exhibit loss of 11 beta-HSD2, the oxidative (11 beta-OH -> 11-keto) enzyme that normally inactivates glucocorticoids, allowing elevated tumor glucocorticoids to drive resistance by stimulating GR. Here, we show that up-regulation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) protein occurs in prostate cancer tissues of men treated with enzalutamide, human-derived cell lines, and patient-derived prostate tissues treated ex vivo with enzalutamide. Genetically silencing H6PD blocks NADPH generation, which inhibits the usual reductive directionality of 11 beta-HSD1, to effectively replace 11 beta-HSD2 function in human-derived cell line models, suppress the concentration of biologically active glucocorticoids in prostate cancer, and reverse enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft models. Similarly, pharmacologic blockade of H6PD with rucaparib normalizes tumor glucocorticoid metabolism in human cell lines and reinstates responsiveness to enzalutamide in mouse xenograft models. Our data show that blockade of H6PD, which is essential for glucocorticoid synthesis in humans, normalizes glucocorticoid metabolism and reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft models. We credential H6PD as a pharmacologic vulnerability for treatment of next-generation androgen receptor antagonist-resistant prostate cancer by depleting tumor glucocorticoids."

Immunotherapy has recently been proven to be an effective treatment strategy. The work here attempts to produce a prognostic immune-related gene pair (IRGP) signature to estimate OV patient survival. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases provided the genetic expression profiles and clinical data of OV patients. Based on the InnateDB database and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, we first identified a 17-IRGP signature associated with survival. The average area under the curve (AUC) values of the training, validation, and all TCGA sets were 0.869, 0.712, and 0.778, respectively. The 17-IRGP signature noticeably split patients into high- and low-risk groups with different prognostic outcomes. As suggested by a functional study, some biological pathways, including the Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling pathways, were significantly negatively correlated with risk scores; however, pathways such as the p53 and apoptosis signalling pathways had a positive correlation. Moreover, tumour stage III, IV, grade G1/G2, and G3/G4 samples had significant differences in risk scores. In conclusion, an effective 17-IRGP signature was produced to predict prognostic outcomes in OV, providing new insights into immunological biomarkers."

The potential role of lamins in cancer progression has been widely revealed. However, the function of lamin B2 (LMNB2) in TNBC progression is still unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of LMNB2 in TNBC. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to examine LMNB2 expression levels. LMNB2 short hairpin RNA plasmid or lentivirus was used to deplete the expression of LMNB2 in human TNBC cell lines including MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231. Alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and the nude mouse tumorigenicity assay in vivo were subsequently analyzed. The human TNBC tissues shown high expression of LMNB2 according to the bioinformation analysis and IHC assays. LMNB2 expression was correlated with the clinical pathological features of TNBC patients, including pTNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Through in vitro and in viva assays, we confirmed LMNB2 depletion suppressed the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of TNBC cells, and inhibited tumor growth of TNBC cells in mice, with the decrease in Ki67 expression or the increase in caspase-3 expression. In conclusion, LMNB2 may promote TNBC progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) facilitate intercellular communication and mediate nerve function and tumour progression. We found that the treatment of mice bearing ovarian tumour with sEVs derived from cerebral endothelial cells (CEC-sEVs) in combination with a chemo-drug, oxaliplatin, robustly reduced oxaliplatin-induced CIPN by decreasing oxaliplatin-damaged myelination and nerve fibres of the sciatic nerve and significantly amplified chemotherapy of oxaliplatin by reducing tumour size. The combination therapy substantially increased a set of sEV cargo-enriched miRNAs, but significantly reduced oxaliplatin-increased proteins in the sciatic nerve and tumour tissues. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the altered miRNAs and proteins formed two distinct networks that regulate neuropathy and tumour growth, respectively. Intravenously administered CEC-sEVs were internalized by axons of the sciatic nerve and cancer cells. Reduction of CEGsEV cargo miRNAs abolished the effects of CEC-sEVs on oxaliplatin-inhibited axonal growth and on amplification of the anti-cancer effect in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that alterations in the networks of miRNAs and proteins in recipient cells contribute to the therapeutic effect of CEC-sEVs on CIPN. Together, the present study demonstrates that CEC-sEVs suppressed CIPN and enhanced chemotherapy of oxaliplatin in the mouse bearing ovarian tumour."

We have previously shown that ovarian cancer cells acquire an increasingly glycolytic and metabolic flexible phenotype during progression. In the present study, we investigated how hypoxia, aggregation, and the incorporation of the obese stromal vascular fraction (SVF) affect cellular metabolism and the response to common anti-cancer and anti-diabetic drugs. Our results show a reduction of glucose uptake, lactate secretion, cellular respiration and ATP synthesis in response to hypoxia and aggregation, suggesting that the observed reduced proliferation of cells aggregated into spheroids is the result of a down-regulation of respiration. Recruitment of SVF to spheroids increased the spheroids invasive capacity but reduced respiration only in the most aggressive cells. Further, aggregation and hypoxia reduced the response to the metabolic drugs AICAR and metformin, and the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and paclitaxel. Our results suggest that the adaptation of cellular metabolism may contribute to enhanced survival under non-permissive conditions, and that these metabolic alterations may provide targets for future interventions that aim to enhance the survival of women with metastatic ovarian cancer."

However, cancer cell stemness-associated lncRNAs and their relevance in prediction of clinical prognosis remain largely unexplored. In this study, through the transcriptome-wide screen, we identified a total of 136 LCSC-associated lncRNAs. We evaluated the prognostic value of these lncRNAs and optimally established an 11-lncRNA (including AC008622.2, AC015908.3, AC020915.2, AC025176.1, AC026356.2, AC099850.3, CYTOR, DDX11-AS1, HTR2A-AS1, LINC02870, and SNHG3) prognostic risk model. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk score is an independent prognostic predictor for HCC patients, which outperforms the traditional clinical pathological factors. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that the high-risk score reflects the alteration of pathways involved in cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolism. Furthermore, functional studies on SNHG12, the leading candidate of the risk lncRNAs, revealed that knockdown of SNHG12 reduces the abilities of HCC cells stemness, proliferation, migration, and invasion. In summary, we constructed a prognostic risk model based on 11 LCSC-associated lncRNAs, which might be a promising prognostic predictor for HCC patients and highlight the involvement of lncRNAs in LCSC-associated treatment strategy in clinical practice."

Both PP1 and PKA can be inhibited by dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 kD (DARPP-32). Using immunohistochemistry, PKA and PP1 expression was determined in a large primary breast tumour cohort to evaluate associations between clinical outcome and clinicopathological criteria (n > 1100). In addition, mRNA expression of PKA and PP1 subunits was assessed in the METABRIC data set (n = 1980). Low protein expression of PKA was significantly associated with adverse survival of breast cancer patients; interestingly, this relationship was stronger in ER-positive breast cancer patients. PP1 protein expression was not associated with patient survival. PKA and PP1 subunit mRNA was also assessed; PPP1CA, PRKACG and PRKAR1B were associated with breast cancer-specific survival. In patients with high expression of DARPP-32, low expression of PP1 was associated with adverse survival when compared to high expression in the same group. PKA expression and PP1 expression are of significant interest in cancer as they are involved in a wide array of cellular processes, and these data indicate PKA and PP1 may play an important role in patient outcome."

Unprecedented public health actions were introduced, including social distancing, travel restrictions and quarantine. The Belgian government announced a national emergency plan, thereby postponing all non-urgent medical consultations and operations. This report analyses the impact of these measures on cancer screening, through assessment of the workload of a laboratory for histopathology and cytopathology. Methods: Data on monthly numbers of histological and cytological samples, immunohistochemistry and molecular tests were extracted from the laboratory information management system. Results: The global histopathological and cytological workload was substantially reduced. The impact on oncology-related surgical procedures was rather limited. The anti-COVID-19 measures significantly diminished all screening-related samples, such as colon biopsies, breast biopsies and cervical cytology, and strongly reduced the number of samples related to functional pathology, such as thyroidectomies and gastric biopsies. Conclusions: Since many health care interventions are reflected in the workload of a pathology laboratory, this study enabled us to identify areas for deconfinement health care actions. Our findings indicate that various areas in medicine were affected, but the impact seemed largest for cancer screening. Health care professionals should assure that consultations related to cancer screening are postponed instead of cancelled."

Our previous studies showed that the number of CTCs could be utilized for recurrence prediction in colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the odds ratio was still lower than five. To improve prognosis in CRC patients, we analyzed CTC clusters/microemboli, CTC numbers, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)/carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels using a self-assembled cell array (SACA) chip system for recurrence prediction. In CRC patients, the presence of CTC clusters/microemboli may have higher correlation in metastasis when compared to the high number of CTCs. Additionally, when both the number of CTCs and serum CEA levels are high, very high odds ratios of 24.4 and 17.1 are observed in patients at all stages and stage III of CRC, respectively. The high number of CTCs and CTC clusters/microemboli simultaneously suggests the high chance of relapse (odds ratio 8.4). Overall, the characteristic of CTC clusters/microemboli, CEA level, and CTC number have a clinical potential to enhance CRC prognosis."

Hsa_circ_0053063 is a circRNA generated from several exons of HADHA. The potential role of hsa_circ_0053063 in BC remains unknown and needs to be explored. Hsa_circ_0053063 was mainly located in the cytoplasm and activated in BC tissues and cell lines. The binding position between hsa_circ_0053063 and miR-330-3p was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, hsa_circ_0053063 inhibited cell viability, proliferation, and progression of BC through the negative regulation of miR-330-3p. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a direct target of miR-330-3p. Besides, the over-expression of miR-330-3p promoted cell progression by directly targeting and regulating PDCD4. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_0053063 activated PDCD4 by targeting miR-330-3p to inhibit BC progression. In conclusion, hsa_circ_0053063 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation via hsa_circ_0053063/hsa-miR-330-3p/PDCD4 axis, which may provide a new therapeutic target for BC patients."

In particular, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new class of small RNAs transcribed from the genome, which modulate the expression of specific genes at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, thus adding a new regulatory layer in the flux of genetic information. In cancer cells, the miRNAs and lncRNAs interactions with its target genes and functional pathways are deregulated as a consequence of epigenetic and genetic alterations occurring during tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize the actual knowledge on the interplay of lncRNAs with its cognate miRNAs and mRNAs pairs, which interact in coregulatory networks with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms underlying its oncogenic behavior in ovarian cancer. Specifically, we reviewed here the evidences unraveling the relevant roles of lncRNAs/miRNAs pairs in altered regulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, therapy resistance, and Warburg effect.

In the process, cancer cells migrate through narrow interstitial spaces substantially smaller in cross-section than the cell. During such confined migration, cancer cells experience extensive nuclear deformation, nuclear envelope rupture, and DNA damage. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the confined migration-induced DNA damage remain incompletely understood. Although in some cell lines, DNA damage is closely associated with nuclear envelope rupture, we show that, in others, mechanical deformation of the nucleus is sufficient to cause DNA damage, even in the absence of nuclear envelope rupture. This deformation-induced DNA damage, unlike nuclear-envelope-rupture-induced DNA damage, occurs primarily in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and is associated with replication forks. Nuclear deformation, resulting from either confined migration or external cell compression, increases replication stress, possibly by increasing replication fork stalling, providing a molecular mechanism for the deformation-induced DNA damage. Thus, we have uncovered a new mechanism for mechanically induced DNA damage, linking mechanical deformation of the nucleus to DNA replication stress. This mechanically induced DNA damage could not only increase genomic instability in metastasizing cancer cells but could also cause DNA damage in non-migrating cells and tissues that experience mechanical compression during development, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis and DNA damage response activation."

This study investigated alterations induced in skeletal muscle by BC-derived factors in an in vitro conditioned media (CM) system and tested the hypothesis that BC cells secrete a factor that represses PPAR-c (PPARG) expression and its transcriptional activity, leading to downregulation of PPARG target genes involved in mitochondrial function and other metabolic pathways. We found that BC-derived factors repress PPAR-mediated transcriptional activity without altering protein expression of PPARG. Furthermore, we show that BC-derived factors induce significant alterations in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and lipid accumulation, which are rescued with exogenous expression of PPARG. The PPARG agonist drug rosiglitazone was able to rescue BC-induced lipid accumulation but did not rescue effects of BC-derived factors on PPAR-mediated transcription or mitochondrial function. These data suggest that BC-derived factors alter lipid accumulation and mitochondrial function via different mechanisms that are both related to PPARG signaling, with mitochondrial dysfunction likely being altered via repression of PPAR-mediated transcription, and lipid accumulation being altered via transcription-independent functions of PPARG."

RCC is always resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and weakly sensitive to immunotherapeutic agents. Therefore, novel agents and approaches are urgently needed for the treatment of RCC. Emodin, an anthraquinone compound extracted from rhubarb and other traditional Chinese herbs, has been implicated in a wide variety of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor activities. However, its role in RCC remains unknown. In this study, we found that emodin effectively killed renal cancer cells without significant toxicity to noncancerous cell HK-2. Flow cytometry assay with Annexin V-FITC and PI demonstrated that emodin induces necroptosis, but not apoptosis, in renal cancer cells. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation levels of RIP1 and MLKL, the key necroptosis-related proteins, were significantly increased. To explore how emodin inhibits kidney tumor growth, we tested reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and found that the levels of ROS increased upon emodin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that emodin induces necroptosis through ROS-mediated activation of JNK signaling pathway and also inhibits glycolysis by downregulation of GLUT1 through ROS-mediated inactivation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings revealed the potential mechanisms by which emodin suppresses renal cancer cell growth and will help develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with JNK- or PI3K/AKT-dysregulated renal cancer."

Protein kinase C-alpha (PKC alpha) is overexpressed in many kinds of cancers. Additionally, PKC alpha is considered an oncogene that regulates proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle in multiple cancers. However, the mechanism underlying how these cellular processes are regulated by PKC alpha remains unknown. In the present study, we used PKC alpha siRNA to knock down PKC alpha gene expression and found that down-regulation of PKC alpha could significantly inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induce apoptosis and G1/S cell cycle arrest in vitro. Overexpression of PKC alpha promotes tumour growth in vivo. We applied cDNA microarray technology to detect the differential gene expression in J82 cells with PKC alpha knockdown and found that five key genes (BIRC2, BIRC3, CDK4, TRAF1 and BMP4) were involved in proliferation and apoptosis according to GO analysis and pathway analyses. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between PKC alpha expression and the expression of five downstream genes.

However, decellularizing porcine esophagus to obtain decellularized esophageal matrix (DEM) for potential biomedical applications has not been widely investigated. In this study a modified decellularization protocol was employed to prepare a porcine esophageal DEM for the study of cancer cell growth. The cellular removal and retention of matrix components in the porcine DEM were fully characterized. The microstructure of the DEM was observed using scanning electronic microscopy. Human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and human primary esophageal fibroblast cells (FBCs) were seeded in the DEM to observe their growth. Results show that the decellularization process did not cause significant loss of mechanical properties and that blood ducts and lymphatic vessels in the submucosa layer were also preserved. ESCC and FBCs grew on the DEM well and the matrix did not show any toxicity to cells. When FBS and ESCC were cocultured on the matrix, they secreted more periostin, a protein that supports cell adhesion on matrix. This study shows that the modified decellularization protocol can effectively remove the cell materials and maintain the microstructure of the porcine esophageal matrix, which has the potential application of studying cell growth and migration for esophageal cancer models."

In gallbladder cancer (GBC), SERPINB5's aberrant expression is reported but its role in genetic predisposition is not known. We enrolled 270 cases and 296 controls and genotyped them for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using direct DNA sequencing, followed by genotype-phenotype analysis in GBC and other cancer cell lines. Luciferase assay was done to determine the role of rs2289521 SNP on expression regulation. We found that two SERPINB5 variants rs2289519 and rs2289521 are significantly associated with GBC and contribute to genetic predisposition. The TT genotype of variant rs2289519 was found to be significantly associated (p = 0.008) with GBC in a recessive model. C allele of rs2289521 increased the risk for GBC significantly at genotypic (CT, p = 0.026) and allelic (p = 0.04) levels. In silico analysis and luciferase assay uncovered the probable regulatory role of the rs2289521 variant on expression. Genotype-phenotype correlation in GBC and breast cancer cell lines showed reduced expression of SERPINB5 in the presence of C allele that was consistent with the result of luciferase assay. Overall, our study reveals the genetic association of two SERPINB5 variants with GBC and rs2289521's possible role in the regulation of expression."

To date, immunotherapy has become an effective means to improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have also been associated with the immune response. However, the role of immune-related lncRNAs in the immune response of pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study, we identified immune-related lncRNA pairs through a new combinatorial algorithm, and then clustered and deeply analyzed the immune characteristics and functional differences between subtypes. Subsequently, the prognostic model of 3 candidate lncRNA pairs was determined by multivariate COX analysis. The results showed significant prognostic differences between the C1 and C2 subtypes, which may be due to the differential infiltration of CTL and NK cells and the activation of tumor-related pathways. The prognostic model of the 3 lncRNA pairs (AC244035.1_vs._AC063926.1, AC066612.1_vs._AC090124.1, and AC244035.1_vs._LINC01885) was established, which exhibits stable and effective prognostic prediction performance. These 3 lncRNA pairs may regulate the anti-tumor effect of immune cells through ion channel pathways. In conclusion, our research demonstrated the panoramic differences in immune characteristics between subtypes and stable prognostic models, and identified new potential targets for immunotherapy."

Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are derived from the transcription of enhancers and has attracted increasing attention in cancers recently. However, the biological functions and clinical significance of eRNAs in OV have not been well described presently. We used an integrated data analysis to identify prognostic-related eRNAs in OV. Tissue-specific enhancer-derived RNAs and their regulating genes were considered as putative eRNA?target pairs using the computational pipeline PreSTIGE. Gene expression profiles and clinical data of OV and 32 other cancer types were obtained from the UCSC Xena platform. Altogether, 71 eRNAs candidates showed significant correlation with overall survival (OS) of OV samples (Kaplan?Meier log-rank test, P 0.05). Among which, 23 were determined to be correlated with their potential target genes (Spearman?s r 0.3, P<0.001). It was found that among the 23 prognostic-related eRNAs, the expression of forkhead box P4 antisense RNA 1 (FOXP4-AS1) had the highest positive correlation with its predicted target gene FOXP4 (Spearman?s r = 0.61). Moreover, the results were further validated by RT-qPCR analysis in an independent OV cohort. Our results suggested the eRNA FOXP4-AS1 expression index may be a favorable independent prognostic biomarker candidate in OV."

However, there is growing evidence that reprogrammed mitochondria also play an important metabolic role in metastatic dissemination. Two constituents of the reprogrammed mitochondria of cancer cells are the intracellular tyrosine kinase Fer and its cancer- and sperm-specific variant, FerT. Here, we show that Fer and FerT control mitochondrial susceptibility to therapeutic and hypoxic stress in metastatic colon (SW620) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC-H1299) cells. Fer- and FerT-deficient SW620 and H1299 cells (SW increment Fer/FerT and H increment Fer/FerT cells, respectively) become highly sensitive to metformin treatment and to hypoxia under glucose-restrictive conditions. Metformin impaired mitochondrial functioning that was accompanied by ATP deficiency and robust death in SW increment Fer/FerT and H increment Fer/FerT cells compared to the parental SW620 and H1299 cells. Notably, selective knockout of the fer gene without affecting FerT expression reduced sensitivity to metformin and hypoxia seen in SW increment Fer/FerT cells. Thus, Fer and FerT modulate the mitochondrial susceptibility of metastatic cancer cells to hypoxia and metformin. Targeting Fer/FerT may therefore provide a novel anticancer treatment by efficient, selective, and more versatile disruption of mitochondrial function in malignant cells."

One major cause for failure of NPC chemotherapeutic treatments is reportedly correlated with the elevation of cancer stem cell (CSC) fractions. Thus, this present study aims to investigate the effect of cisplatin (CDDP) treatment on the enrichment of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and its associated signaling pathway in EBV-negative NPC cells. Cisplatin-pretreated 5-8F NPC cells (5-8F CDDP) were first generated by treating the cells with 0.5 mu M cisplatin for 48 h. After the instant treatment, 5-8F CDDP showed increased IC50 values, demonstrating a decrease in CDDP sensitization. Besides, the proportion of NPC cells with cancer stem-like phenotypes comprising side population (SP), key stemness-related gene expressions including SOX2, ALDH1, CD24 was significantly enhanced. Additionally, 5-8F CDDP displayed the upregulation of beta-catenin gene, suggesting its association with the CSC-initiating mechanism. Furthermore, a tankyrase inhibitor for Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, XAV939, substantially reduced CSCs and retrieved the cisplatin sensitivity in 5-8F CDDP. This confirms that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is accountable for rising of the CSC population in EBV-negative NPC. Finally, the combined treatment of CDDP and XAV939 exhibited lower 5-8F CDDP cell viability compared to the treatment of CDDP alone, suggesting the reversal of cisplatin sensitization. In conclusion, the enhancement of CSCs in 5-8F NPC cells caused by the instant cisplatin treatment is initially mediated through the upregulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. As a result, a primary chemotherapeutic treatment with closely monitoring the targeted Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway could potentially prevent the development of CSCs and improve the treatment efficiency in NPC."

Here, we examined glycolytic pathway metabolites, enzyme activity and transport proteins in skeletal muscle, liver and tumours of mice with cachexia-related weight loss induced by colon-26 cancer cells. Skeletal muscle of cachexic mice had increased [L-lactate]/[pyruvate], LDH activity and lactate transporter MCT1. Cachexic livers also showed increased MCT1. This is consistent with the proposal that the rate of muscle-derived lactate shuttling to liver for use in gluconeogenesis is increased, that is, an increased Cori cycle flux in weight-losing cachexic mice. A second shuttle between liver and tumour may also contribute to disrupted energy balance and weight loss. We found increased high-affinity glucose transporter GLUT1 in tumours, suggesting active glucose uptake, tumour MCT1 detection and decreased intratumour [L-lactate]/[pyruvate], implying increased lactate efflux and/or intratumour lactate oxidation. Last, high [L-lactate]/[pyruvate] and MCT1 in cachexic muscle provides a potential muscle-derived lactate supply for the tumour (a 'reverse Warburg effect'), supporting tumour growth and consequent cachexia. Our findings suggest several substrate shuttles among liver, skeletal muscle and tumour contribute to metabolic disruption and weight loss. Therapies that aim to normalize dysregulated substrate shuttling among energy-regulating tissues may alleviate unintended weight loss in cancer cachexia. Significance of the study Cachexia is a serious complication of cancer characterized by severe weight loss, muscle atrophy and frailty. Cachexia occurs in roughly half of all cancer patients, and in up to 80% of patients with advanced disease. Cachexia independently worsens patient prognosis, lowers treatment efficacy, increases hospitalization cost and length of stay, and accounts for 20-30% of cancer-related deaths. There are no effective treatments. Our findings suggest several substrate shuttles among liver, skeletal muscle and tumour contribute to metabolic disruption and weight loss in cancer cachexia. Identifying therapies that normalize dysregulated substrate shuttling among energy-regulating tissues may protect against cachexia-related weight loss."

Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) protein has risen recently as the crucial factor in malignancies and plays a potential role in diverse complex oncogenic signaling cascades. AEG-1 has multiple roles in tumor growth and development and is found to be involved in various signaling pathways of: (i) Ha-ras and PI3K/AKT; (ii) the NF-kappa B; (iii) the ERK or mitogen-activated protein kinase and Wnt or beta-catenin and (iv) the Aurora-A kinase. Recent studies have confirmed that in all the hallmarks of cancers, AEG-1 plays a key functionality including progression, transformation, sustained angiogenesis, evading apoptosis, and invasion and metastasis. Clinical studies have supported that AEG-1 is actively intricated in tumor growth and progression which includes esophageal squamous cell, gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, gallbladder, breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancers, as well as renal cell carcinomas, melanoma, glioma, neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. Existing studies have reported that AEG-1 expression has been induced by Ha-ras through intrication of PI3K/AKT signaling. Conversely, AEG-1 also activates PI3K/AKT pathway and modulates the defined subset of downstream target proteins via crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hedgehog signaling cascade which further plays a crucial role in metastasis. Thus, AEG-1 may be employed as a biomarker to discern the patients of those who are likely to get aid from AEG-1-targeted medication. AEG-1 may play as an effective target to repress tumor development, occlude metastasis, and magnify the effectiveness of treatments. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanism of AEG-1 in the process of carcinogenesis and its involvement in regulation of crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hedgehog signaling. We also highlight the multifaceted functions, expression, clinicopathological significance and molecular inhibitors of AEG-1 in various cancer types."

Majority of the alternative splicing events are known to occur in the nuclear matrix where various MARBPs actively participate in the alternative splicing events. SMAR1, being a MARBP and an important tumor suppressor, is known to regulate the splicing of various cancer-associated genes. This study focuses on the regulation of PKM alternative splicing and inhibition of the Warburg effect by SMAR1. Methods Immunohistochemistry was performed in breast cancer patient samples to establish the correlation between SMAR1 and PKM isoform expression. Further, expression of PKM isoforms upon modulation in SMAR1 expression in breast cancer cell lines was quantified by qRT-PCR and western blot. The acetylation status of PTBP1 was estimated by immunoprecipitation along with its enrichment on PKM pre-mRNA by CLIP in SMAR1 knockdown conditions. The role of SMAR1 in tumor metabolism and tumorigenesis was explored by in vitro enzymatic assays and functional assays upon SMAR1 knockdown. Besides, in vivo tumor formation by injecting adeno-SMAR1-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells in NOD/SCID mice was performed. Results The expression profile of SMAR1 and PKM isoforms in breast cancer patients revealed that SMAR1 has an inverse correlation with PKM2 and a positive correlation with PKM1. Further quantitative PKM isoform expression upon modulation in SMAR1 expression also reflects that SMAR1 promotes the expression of PKM1 over tumorigenic isoform PKM2. SMAR1 deacetylates PTBP1 via recruitment of HDAC6 resulting in reduced enrichment of PTBP1 on PKM pre-mRNA. SMAR1 inhibits the Warburg effect, tumorigenic potential of cancer cells, and in vivo tumor generation in a PKM2-dependent manner. Conclusions SMAR1 regulates PKM alternative splicing by causing HDAC6-dependent deacetylation of PTBP1, resulting in reduced enrichment of PTBP1 on PKM pre-mRNA. Additionally, SMAR1 suppresses glucose utilization and lactate production via repression of PKM2 expression. This suggests that tumor suppressor SMAR1 inhibits tumor cell metabolism and tumorigenic properties of cancer cells via regulation of PKM alternative splicing."

It is important to predict the prostate's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and the disease outcome by assessing TMPRSS2 expression in cancer tissues. In this study, we conducted the expression profiles of the TMPRSS2 gene for COVID-19 in different normal tissues and PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) tumour tissues. TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in normal tissues including the small intestine, prostate, pancreas, salivary gland, colon, stomach, seminal vesicle and lung, and is increased in PRAD tissues, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might attack not only the lungs and other normal organs, but also in PRAD cancer tissues. Hypomethylation of TMPRSS2 promoter may not be the mechanism for TMPRSS2 overexpression in PRAD tissues and PRAD pathogenesis. TMPRSS2 expresses eleven isoforms in PRAD tissues, with the TMPRSS2-001 isoform expressed highest and followed by TMPRSS2-201. Further isoform structures prediction showed that these two highly expressed isoforms have both SRCR_2 and Trypsin (Tryp_SPc) domains, which may be essential for TMPRSS2 functional roles for tumorigenesis and entry for SARS-CoV-2 in PRAD patients. Analyses of functional annotation and enrichment in TMPRSS2 showed that TMPRSS2 is mostly enriched in regulation of viral entry into host cells, protein processing and serine-type peptidase activity. TMPRSS2 is also associated with prostate gland cancer cell expression, different complex(es) formation, human influenza and carcinoma, pathways in prostate cancer, influenza A, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Altogether, even though high expression of TMPRSS2 may not be favourable for PRAD patient's survival, increased expression in these patients should play roles in susceptibility of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical severity for COVID-19, highlighting the value of protective actions of PRAD cases by targeting or androgen-mediated therapeutic strategies in the COVID-19 pandemic."

Developments of efficient therapeutic strategies are required for the CAC treatments. This long-term process could be shortened by the drug-repositioning approach which exploits old drugs approved for non-cachexia disease. Amiloride, a diuretic drug, is clinically used for treatments of hypertension and edema due to heart failure. Here, we explored the effects of the amiloride treatment for ameliorating muscle wasting in murine models of cancer cachexia. Methods: The CT26 and LLC tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into mice to induce colon cancer cachexia and lung cancer cachexia, respectively. Amiloride was intraperitoneally injected daily once tumors were formed. Cachexia features of the CT26 model and the LLC model were separately characterized by phenotypic, histopathologic and biochemical analyses. Plasma exosomes and muscle atrophy-related proteins were quantitatively analyzed. Integrative NMR-based metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were conducted to identify significantly altered metabolic pathways and distinctly changed metabolism-related biological processes in gastrocnemius. Results: The CT26 and LLC cachexia models displayed prominent cachexia features including decreases in body weight, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and muscle strength. The amiloride treatment in tumor-bearing mice distinctly alleviated muscle atrophy and relieved cachexia-related features without affecting tumor growth. Both the CT26 and LLC cachexia mice showed increased plasma exosome densities which were largely derived from tumors. Significantly, the amiloride treatment inhibited tumor-derived exosome release, which did not obviously affect exosome secretion from non-neoplastic tissues or induce observable systemic toxicities in normal healthy mice. Integrative-omics revealed significant metabolic impairments in cachectic gastrocnemius, including promoted muscular catabolism, inhibited muscular protein synthesis, blocked glycolysis, and impeded ketone body oxidation. The amiloride treatment evidently improved the metabolic impairments in cachectic gastrocnemius. Conclusions: Amiloride ameliorates cachectic muscle wasting and alleviates cancer cachexia progression through inhibiting tumor-derived exosome release. Our results are beneficial to understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms, shedding light on the potentials of amiloride in cachexia therapy."

Since metabolism is a dynamic process, it involves several physiological variables that circadian cycling. The clock genes alterations can affect multiple systems concomitantly, because they constitute the promoter factors for relevant metabolic pathways. Considering the intertwined structure of signaling, regulatory, and metabolic processes within a cell, we employed a genome-scale biomolecular network. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of diabetic-associated transcriptomic datasets was performed, and the core information on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was obtained by statistical analyses. In the current study, meta-analysis was performed on type 2 diabetes, circadian rhythm-related genes, and breast, bladder, liver, pancreas, colon and rectum cancer-associated transcriptome data using the integration of gene expression profiles with genome-scale biomolecular networks in diabetes samples. First, we detected downregulated and upregulated DEGs in mouse cortex and hypothalamus samples of mice with sleep deprivation. In summary, upregulated genes active genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, cancer and diabetes, mainly in hypothalamus specimens. In cortex, we observed mainly downregulation of immune system. DEGs were combined with 214 circadian rhythm related genes to type 2 DM and cancer samples. We observed that several common genes deregulated in both diseases. Klf10, Ntkr3, Igf1, Usp2, Ezh2 were both downregulated in type 2 DM and cancer samples, while Arntl2 and Agrp were upregulated. It seems that the changes in mRNA are contributing to the phenotypic changes in type 2 DM, resulting in phenotypic changes associated with the malignant transformation. Taking those genes to perform a survival analysis, we found only Igf1, Usp2 and Arntl2 genes associated with patient outcomes. While Igf1 and Usp2 downregulation had a negative impact, Arntl2 upregulation was associated with poor survival both in BLCA and BRCA cancer samples. Our data stimulate efforts in news studies to achieve the experimental and clinical validation about these biomolecules."

Serum samples from 296 patients with NSCLC and 240 healthy controls were collected. The levels of serum MIC-1 were determined by ELISA. The serum MIC-1 levels in NSCLC patients were higher than that of the controls (P <.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that serum MIC-1 was an independent prognostic indicator of OS and PFS. Serum MIC-1 is a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC.

The role of ARHGAP family genes in BCa and its association with immuno-microenvironment remain largely unknown. ARHGAP family expression and immune infiltration in BCa were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis. Then, we investigated cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vivo and in vitro of the ARHGAP family. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed in measuring cellular mechanical properties of BCa cells. The results demonstrated that ARHGAP family genes correlate with a tumor-promoting microenvironment with a lower Th1/Th2 cell ratio, higher DC cell infiltration, higher Treg cell infiltration, and T-cell exhaustion phenotype. Silencing ARHGAP5, ARHGAP17, and ARHGAP24 suppressed BCa cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis. Knocking down of ARHGAPs in T24 cells caused a relatively higher Young's modulus and lower adhesive force and cell height. Taken together, ARHGAP family genes promote BCa progressing through establishing a tumor-promoting microenvironment and promoting cancer progression."

A major limitation of ICB is that most patients fail to respond, which is partly attributable to immunosuppression. Obesity appears to improve immune checkpoint therapies in some cancers, but impacts on breast cancer (BC) remain unknown. In lean and obese mice, tumor progression and immune reprogramming were quantified in BC tumors treated with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or control. Obesity augments tumor incidence and progression. Anti-PD-1 induces regression in lean mice and potently abrogates progression in obese mice. BC primes systemic immunity to be highly responsive to obesity, leading to greater immunosuppression, which may explain greater anti-PD-1 efficacy. Anti-PD-1 significantly reinvigorates antitumor immunity despite persistent obesity. Laminin subunit beta-2 (Lamb2), downregulated by anti-PD-1, significantly predicts patient survival. Lastly, a microbial signature associated with anti-PD-1 efficacy is identified. Thus, anti-PD-1 is highly efficacious in obese mice by reinvigorating durable antitumor immunity."

TGFBI has been most studied in the context of hereditary corneal dystrophies, where mutations in TGFBI result in accumulation of TGFBI in the cornea. In cancer, early studies focused on TGFBI as a tumor suppressor, in part by promoting chemotherapy sensitivity. However, in established tumors, TGFBI largely has a role in promoting tumor progression, with elevated levels correlating to poorer clinical outcomes. As an important regulator of cancer progression, TGFBI expression and function is tightly regulated by numerous mechanisms including epigenetic silencing through promoter methylation and microRNAs. Mechanisms to target TGFBI have potential clinical utility in treating advanced cancers, while assessing TGFBI levels could be a biomarker for chemotherapy resistance and tumor progression."

Here, we demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibitors cause glycolytic crisis, acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) shortage, and a global decrease in histone acetylation. In addition, PI3K/AKT inhibitors induce drug resistance by selectively augmenting histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and binding of CBP/p300 and BRD4 proteins at a subset of growth factor and receptor (GF/R) gene loci. BRD4 occupation at these loci and drug-resistant cell growth are vulnerable to both bromodomain and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Little or no occupation of HDAC proteins at the GF/R gene loci underscores the paradox that cells respond equivalently to the two classes of inhibitors with opposite modes of action. Targeting this unique acetyl-histone-related vulnerability offers two clinically viable strategies to overcome PI3K/AKT inhibitor resistance in different cancers."

To identify systems-level alterations in redox metabolism that confer resistance to radiation therapy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for integrating multiomics data into personalized genome-scale flux balance analysis models of 716 radiation-sensitive and 199 radiation-resistant tumors. These models collectively predicted that radiation-resistant tumors reroute metabolic flux to increase mitochondrial NADPH stores and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Simulated genome-wide knockout screens agreed with experimental siRNA gene knockdowns in matched radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant cancer cell lines, revealing gene targets involved in mitochondrial NADPH production, central carbon metabolism, and folate metabolism that allow for selective inhibition of glutathione production and H2O2 clearance in radiation-resistant cancers.

This phenomenon was first observed at the level of cellular energetics, in the form of very high rates of lactic acid fermentation, not only in anoxia, but also in the presence of oxygen levels that do not compromise respiration. This intriguing tumor phenotype, characterized by a very low energy yield, was unveiled, in the early 1920s, by Otto Warburg, one of the greatest biochemists of all time. This manuscript outlines aspects of Warburg's personal and research life that, in retrospect, might be viewed as a preparation for his successful approach to the cancer problem. It also discusses the experiments that led to the discovery and briefly presents Warburg's theory for the origin of tumors. Finally, it concludes with considerations regarding the novel avenues that this monumental and still intriguing discovery opened in terms of diagnosis and treatment of cancer."

Due to its dynamic nature, a sophisticated and constantly remodeling mechanism needs to be set up to maintain the Golgi architecture and function in the non-stop trafficking of proteins and lipids. Abundant evidence has been accumulated that a well-organized Golgi structure is required for its proper functions, especially protein glycosylation. Remarkably, altered glycosylation has been a hallmark of most cancer cells. To understand the causes of Golgi defects in cancer, efforts have been made to characterize Golgi structural proteins under physiological and pathological conditions. This review summarizes the current knowledge of crucial Golgi structural proteins and their connections with tumor progression. We foresee that understanding the Golgi structural and functional defects may help solve the puzzle of whether glycosylation defect is a cause or effect of oncogenesis."

This rich and heterogeneous content has been given intense attention in cancer physiopathology because EVs support cancer control and progression. Because of their specific active cargo, they are being evaluated as carriers of liquid biopsy biomarkers. Compared to soluble circulating biomarkers, their complexity might provide rich information on tumor and metastases status. Thanks to the acquired genomic changes commonly observed in oncogenic processes, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in EVs might be the latest most promising biomarker of tumor presence and complexity.

Here, we analyzed the gene expression data of 24 major m6A RNA methylation regulators from 775 patients with EC from TCGA dataset. The present study showed the aberrations of m6A regulators in genome were correlated to prognosis in human ECs. Meanwhile, 17 m6A regulators showed increased expression in EC samples, including YTHDC1, IGF2BP2, FTO, METTL14, YTHDF3, RBM15, WTAP, HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPC, ALKBH5, YTHDF2, METTL16, IGF2BP3, VIRMA, RBM15B, YTHDF1, KIAA1429, HAKAI, and ZC3H13. Among them, we found HNRNPC, YTHDC2, WTAP, VIRMA, IGF2BP3, and HNRNPA2B1 were significantly correlated to worse outcomes and advanced stage in EC. Furthermore, we showed levels of m6A regulators is correlated with the expression of Immuno-regulators (Immunoinhibitors, Immunostimulators, and MHC molecules) and immune infiltration levels in EC. Bioinformatics further confirm m6A regulators were involved in regulating RNA splicing, RNA stability, and cell proliferation. Our study showed m6A regulators are promising targets and biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy in EC."

Host cells derived from myeloid and lymphoid lineages perform well-established functions linked to cancer development, progression, and response to therapy. It is unclear whether host erythroid cells also contribute to shaping the path that cancer can take, but emerging evidence points to this possibility. Here, we show that tumor-promoting environmental stress and tumor-induced hemodynamic changes trigger renal erythropoietin production and erythropoietin-dependent expansion of splenic erythroid cell populations in mice. These erythroid cells display molecular features indicative of an immature erythroid phenotype, such as the expression of both CD71 and TER119 and the retention of intact nuclei, and express genes encoding immune checkpoint molecules. Nucleated erythroid cells with similar properties are present in mouse and human tumor tissues. Antibody-mediated erythropoietin blockade reduces tumor-responsive erythroid cell induction and tumor growth. These findings reveal the potential of tumor-induced erythropoietin and erythroid cells as targets for cancer treatment."

Consistent with other reports, we found that the membrane receptor Neuropilin1 (NRP1) is greatly upregulated in colon cancer cells that underwent autophagy upon glucose deprivation. However, the mechanism underlying NRP1 regulation of autophagy is unknown. We found that knockdown of NRP1 inhibits autophagy and largely upregulates the expression of aldo-keto reductase family 1 B10 (AKR1B10). Moreover, we demonstrated that AKR1B10 interacts with and inhibits the nuclear importation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and then subsequently represses autophagy. Interestingly, we also found that an NADPH-dependent reduction reaction could be induced when AKR1B10 interacts with GAPDH, and the reductase activity of AKR1B10 is important for its repression of autophagy. Together, our findings unravel a novel mechanism of NRP1 in regulating autophagy through AKR1B10."

Dysfunction in this fundamental cellular process is linked to a variety of pathologies including neuropathies, cardiovascular disorders, myopathies, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, demonstrating the importance of mitochondrial protein import machinery for cellular function. Correct import of proteins into mitochondria requires the co-ordinated activity of multimeric protein translocation and sorting machineries located in both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, directing the imported proteins to the destined mitochondrial compartment. This dynamic process maintains cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation significantly affects cellular signalling pathways and metabolism. This review summarises current knowledge of the mammalian mitochondrial import machinery and the pathological consequences of mutation of its components. In addition, we will discuss the role of mitochondrial import in cancer, and our current understanding of the role of mitochondrial import in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease."

A majority of cancers achieve telomere maintenance through telomerase expression. However, a subset of cancers takes an alternate route for elongating telomeres: recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Current evidence suggests that break-induced replication (BIR), independent of RAD51, underlies ALT telomere synthesis. However, RAD51-dependent homologous recombination is required for homology search and interchromosomal telomere recombination in human ALT cancer cell maintenance. Accumulating evidence suggests that the breakdown of stalled replication forks, the replication stress, induces BIR at telomeres. Nevertheless, ALT research is still in its early stage and a comprehensive view is still unclear. Here, we review the current findings regarding the genesis of ALT, how this recombinant pathway is chosen, the epigenetic regulation of telomeres in ALT, and perspectives for clinical applications with the hope that this overview will generate new questions."

However, the mechanism of drug resistance is not fully understood. Using tumor models defective in the MMR gene Mlh1 (dMLH1), we show that dMLH1 tumor cells accumulate cytosolic DNA and produce IFN-beta in a cGAS-STING-dependent manner, which renders dMLH1 tumors slowly progressive and highly sensitive to checkpoint blockade. In neoantigen-fixed models, dMLH1 tumors potently induce T cell priming and lose resistance to checkpoint therapy independent of tumor mutational burden. Accordingly, loss of STING or cGAS in tumor cells decreases tumor infiltration of T cells and endows resistance to checkpoint blockade. Clinically, downregulation of cGAS/STING in human dMMR cancers correlates with poor prognosis. We conclude that DNA sensing within tumor cells is essential for dMMR-triggered anti-tumor immunity. This study provides new mechanisms and biomarkers for anti-dMMR-cancer immunotherapy."

This review discusses the complex activity of CYP17A1, looking at its role in both the classical and backdoor steroidogenic pathways and the complex chemistry it carries out to perform both a hydroxylation reaction and a carbon-carbon cleavage, or lyase reaction. Functional and structural investigations have informed our knowledge of these two reactions. This review focuses on a few specific aspects of this discussion: the identities of reaction intermediates, the coordination of hydroxylation and lyase reactions, the effects of cytochrome b5, and conformational selection. These discussions improve understanding of CYP17A1 in a physiological setting, where CYP17A1 is implicated in a variety of steroidogenic diseases. This information can be used to improve ways in which CYP17A1 can be effectively modulated to treat diseases such as prostate and breast cancer, Cushing's syndrome, and glioblastoma."

Although there is still no clear main function of circRNAs, several studies have revealed that circRNAs are expressed in various eukaryotic organisms in a regulated manner often independent of their parental linear isoforms demonstrating conservation across species. circNFATC3, an abundant and uncharacterized circular RNA of exon 2 and 3 from NFATC3, was identified in transcriptomic data of solid tumors. Here we show that circNFATC3 gain- and loss-of-function experiments using RNAi-mediated circRNA silencing and circular mini vector-mediated overexpression of circularized constructs in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines affect molecular phenotypes. The knockdown of circNFATC3 induces a reduction in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and oxidative phosphorylation. Gain-of-function of circNFATC3 in MDA-MB-231 and SK-OV-3 cells show a significant increase in cell proliferation, migration, and respiration. The above results suggest that circNFATC3 is a functionally relevant circular RNA in breast and ovarian cancer."

Here, we demonstrate that oncolytic alphavirus M1 effectively kills both TNBC and non-TNBC. ER-stress and apoptosis pathways are responsible for the cell death in non-TNBC as reported in other cancer types, yet the cell death in TNBC does not depend on these pathways. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the M1 virus activates necroptosis in TNBC, which can be pharmacologically blocked by necroptosis inhibitors. By screening a library of clinically available compounds commonly used for breast cancer treatment, we find that Doxorubicin enhances the oncolytic effect of the M1 virus by up to 100-fold specifically in TNBC in vitro, and significantly stalls the tumor growth of TNBC in vivo, through promoting intratumoral virus replication and further triggering apoptosis in addition to necroptosis. These findings reveal a novel antitumor mechanism and a new combination regimen of the M1 oncolytic virus in TNBC, and highlight a need to bridge molecular diagnosis with virotherapy."

Resulting erosion of telomeres leads eventually to replicative senescence. Reactivation of hTERT maintains telomeres and triggers progression of >90% of cancers. However, any direct causal link between telomeres and telomerase regulation remains unclear. Here, we show that the telomere-repeat-binding-factor 2 (TRF2) binds hTERT promoter G-quadruplexes and recruits the polycomb-repressor EZH2/PRC2 complex. This is causal for H3K27 trimethylation at the hTERT promoter and represses hTERT in cancer as well as normal cells. Two highly recurrent hTERT promoter mutations found in many cancers, including similar to 83% glioblastoma multiforme, that are known to destabilize hTERT promoter G-quadruplexes, showed loss of TRF2 binding in patient-derived primary glioblastoma multiforme cells. Ligand-induced G-quadruplex stabilization restored TRF2 binding, H3K27-trimethylation, and hTERT re-suppression. These results uncover a mechanism of hTERT regulation through a telomeric factor, implicating telomere-telomerase molecular links important in neoplastic transformation, aging, and regenerative therapy."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment by enabling T cell reactivation; however, response biomarkers are required, as most patients do not benefit. Higher TMB results in more neo-antigens, increasing chances for T cell recognition, and clinically correlates with better ICI outcomes. Nevertheless, TMB is an imperfect response biomarker.

To test this idea, we perturbed hepatic homeostasis in mice by dietary challenge and compared the liver transcriptome with that in human fatty liver disease and liver cancer. Co-expression module preservation analysis pointed to alterations in immune responses and metabolism (core modules) in both human and mouse datasets. The extent of derailment in core modules was predictive of survival in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) liver cancer dataset. We identified module eigengene quantitative trait loci (module-eQTL) for these predictive co-expression modules, targeting of which may resolve homeostatic perturbations and improve patient outcomes. The framework presented can be used to understand homeostasis at systems levels in pre-clinical models and in humans.

Here, we identify ferroptosis as a critical mechanism to mediate p53 function in tumor radiosensitivity. Mechanistically, RT-mediated p53 activation antagonizes RT-induced SLC7A11 expression and represses glutathione synthesis, thereby promoting RT-induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. p53 deficiency promotes radioresistance in cancer cells or tumors at least partly through SLC7A11-mediated ferroptosis inhibition. Ferroptosis inducers (FINs) that inhibit SLC7A11 exert significant radiosensitizing effects in tumor organoids and patient-derived xenografts with p53 mutation or deficiency. Finally, we show that RT-induced ferroptosis correlates with p53 activation and better clinical outcomes to RT in cancer patients. Together, our study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of ferroptosis in p53-mediated radiosensitization and suggest using FINs in combination with RT to treat p53-mutant cancers."

Treatment of this BC subtype typically involves modalities that either suppress the production of estrogen or impede the binding of estrgen to its receptors, constituting the basis for endocrine therapy. While many patients have benefitted from endocrine therapy with clear reduction in mortality and cancer recurrence, one of the clinical hurdles that remain involves overcoming intrinsic (de novo) or acquired resistance to endocrine therapy driven by diverse and complex changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, such resistance may persist even after progression through additional antiestrogen therapies thus demonstrating the importance of further investigation of mechanisms of ER modulation. Here, we discuss a number of advances that provide a better understanding of the complex mechanistic basis for resistance to endocrine therapy as well as future therapeutic maneuvers that may break this resistance."

FA pathway inactivation has been demonstrated to specifically kill some types of cancer cells without the addition of exogenous DNA damage, including cells that lack BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, or functionally related genes.

In this study, we investigate the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, in modulating oncogenic cues in the colon. We show that intestinal epithelial cell-targeted AhR knockout (KO) promotes the expansion and clonogenic capacity of colonic stem/progenitor cells harboring Apc(S580/+); Kras(G12D/+) mutations by upregulating Wnt signaling. The loss of AhR in the gut epithelium increased cell proliferation, reduced mouse survival rate, and promoted cecum and colon tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, the antagonism of Wnt signaling induced by Lgr5 haploinsufficiency attenuated the effects of AhR KO on cecum and colon tumorigenesis. Implications: Our findings reveal that AhR signaling plays a protective role in genetically induced colon tumorigenesis at least by suppressing Wnt signaling and provides rationale for the AhR as a therapeutic target for cancer prevention and treatment."

The solid tumor microenvironment is characterized by the presence of immunosuppressive factors, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), that limit NK cell persistence. Here, we investigate if the modulation of the cytokine environment in lung cancer with IL-2 or IL-15 renders NK cells resistant to suppression by PGE2. Analyzing Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we found that high NK cell gene signatures correlate with significantly improved overall survival in patients with high levels of the prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES). In vitro, IL-15, in contrast to IL-2, enriches for CD25(+)/CD54(+) NK cells with superior mTOR activity and increased expression of the cAMP hydrolyzing enzyme phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A). Consequently, this distinct population of NK cells maintains their function in the presence of PGE2 and shows an increased ability to infiltrate lung adenocarcinoma tumors in vitro and in vivo. Thus, strategies to enrich CD25(+)/CD54(+) NK cells for adoptive cell therapy should be considered."

Metabolic reprogramming related to glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism in PDAC not only enables the cancer to thrive and survive under hypovascular, nutrient-poor and hypoxic microenvironments, but also confers chemoresistance, which contributes to the poor prognosis of PDAC. In this review, we systematically elucidate the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance and the relationship of metabolic programming features with resistance to anticancer drugs in PDAC. Targeting the critical enzymes and/or transporters involved in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism may be a promising approach to overcome chemoresistance in PDAC. Consequently, regulating metabolism could be used as a strategy against PDAC and could improve the prognosis of PDAC."

While loss of activity of genes in the DDR has been extensively associated with cancer predisposition and progression, in recent years it has become evident that there is a relationship between the DDR and cellular metabolism. The activity of the metabolic pathways can influence the DDR by regulating the availability of substrates required for the repair process and the function of its players. Additionally, proteins of the DDR can regulate the metabolic flux through the major pathways such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This newly discovered connection bears great importance in the biology of cancer and represents a new therapeutic opportunity. Here we describe the nature of the relationship between DDR and metabolism and its potential application in the treatment of cancer.

The stagnant survival statistics and dismal response rates to current therapeutics highlight the need for more efficient preclinical models. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) offer new possibilities as powerful preclinical models able to account for interpatient variability. Organoid development can be divided into four different key phases: establishment, propagation, drug screening and response prediction. Establishment entails tailored tissue extraction and growth protocols, propagation requires consistent multiplication and passaging, while drug screening and response prediction will benefit from shorter and more precise assays, and clear decision-making tools. Conclusions This review attempts to outline the most important challenges that remain in exploiting organoid platforms for drug discovery and clinical applications. Some of these challenges may be overcome by novel methods that are under investigation, such as 3D bioprinting systems, microfluidic systems, optical metabolic imaging and liquid handling robotics. We also propose an optimized organoid workflow inspired by all technical solutions we have presented."

Using a diverse, clinically relevant panel of cell-line and patient-derived models, we demonstrate that AR activation, not suppression, exerts potent antitumor activity in multiple disease contexts, including resistance to standard-of-care ER and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Notably, AR agonists combined with standard-of-care agents enhanced therapeutic responses. Mechanistically, agonist activation of AR altered the genomic distribution of ER and essential co-activators (p300, SRC-3), resulting in repression of ER-regulated cell cycle genes and upregulation of AR target genes, including known tumor suppressors. A gene signature of AR activity positively predicted disease survival in multiple clinical ER-positive breast cancer cohorts. These findings provide unambiguous evidence that AR has a tumor suppressor role in ER-positive breast cancer and support AR agonism as the optimal AR-directed treatment strategy, revealing a rational therapeutic opportunity."

Our screen uncovered a previously undisclosed, extensive network of genes linking integrin signaling and cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) with inhibition of ciliation in both normal and cancer cells. Surprisingly, a cohort of genes encoding ECM proteins was also identified. We characterized several ciliation inhibitory genes and showed that their silencing was accompanied by altered cytoskeletal organization and induction of ciliation, which restricts cell growth and migration in normal and breast cancer cells. Conversely, supplying an integrin ligand, vitronectin, to the ECM rescued the enhanced ciliation observed on silencing this gene. Aberrant ciliation could also be suppressed through hyperactivation of the YAP/TAZ pathway, indicating a potential mechanistic basis for our findings. Our findings suggest an unanticipated reciprocal relationship between ciliation and cellular adhesion to the ECM and provide a resource that could vastly expand our understanding of controls involving outside-in and inside-out signaling that restrain cilium assembly."

Using a Drosophila solid-tumor model where oncogenic Notch drives tumorigenesis in a transition-zone microenvironment in the salivary gland imaginal ring, we find that the tumor-initiating cells normally undergo endoreplication to become polyploid. Upregulation of Notch signaling, however, induces these polyploid transition-zone cells to re-enter mitosis and undergo tumorigenesis. Growth and progression of the transition-zone tumor are fueled by a combination of polyploid mitosis, endoreplication, and depolyploidization. Both polyploid mitosis and depolyploidization are error prone, resulting in chromosomal copy-number variation and polyaneuploidy. Comparative RNA-seq and epistasis analysis reveal that the DNA-damage response genes, also active during meiosis, are upregulated in these tumors and are required for the ploidy-reduction division. Together, these findings suggest that polyploidy and associated cell-cycle variants are critical for increased tumor-cell heterogeneity and genome instability during cancer progression."

As a result, recent insights in circRNA biology are investigating their biomarker and therapeutic potential. One such circRNA is CircFOXO3, which consists of the circularized second exon of the FOXO3 mRNA, a member of the forkhead box transcription factor family involved in the regulation of developmental programs. Recent research focused on the role of circFOXO3 in the context of cancer has highlighted several implications in key tumorigenesis mechanisms, thus consolidating its relevance among other identified circRNAs. In this paper, we will focus on the currently identified case-specific implications of circFOXO3 in cancer, with a focus on the circFOXO3-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, its interactions with different proteins, and their cumulated biological effects upon tumor development. Therefore, we aim to provide an integrated perspective of the mechanistic implications of circFOXO3 in different cancers while also highlighting its biomarker or therapeutic potential based on the current evidence."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumour-promoting EMT of CAFs in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) remain unclear. Here, we observed that CAFs isolated from lung ADC promoted EMT via production of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in conditioned medium (CM). CAF-derived SDF-1 enhanced invasiveness and EMT by upregulating CXCR4, beta -catenin, and PPAR delta, while downregulating these proteins reversed the effect. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated CXCR4 knockdown suppressed beta -catenin and PPAR delta expression, while beta -catenin inhibition effectively downregulated PPAR delta without affecting CXCR4; however, treatment with a PPAR delta inhibitor did not inhibit CXCR4 or beta -catenin expression. Additionally, pairwise analysis revealed that high expression of CXCR4, beta -catenin, and PPAR delta correlated positively with 75 human lung adenocarcinoma tissues, which was predictive of poor prognosis. Thus, targeting the CAF-derived, SDF-1-mediated CXCR4 beta -catenin/ PPAR delta cascade may serve as an effective targeted approach for lung cancer treatment."

Many tumors overexpress arginase, but it is unclear how these cancers, but not T cells, tolerate arginine depletion. In this study, we show that tumor cells synthesize arginine from citrulline by upregulating argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). Under arginine starvation, ASS1 transcription is induced by ATF4 and CEBP beta binding to an enhancer within ASS1. T cells cannot induce ASS1, despite the presence of active ATF4 and CEBP beta, as the gene is repressed. Arginine starvation drives global chromatin compaction and repressive histone methylation, which disrupts ATF4/CEBP beta binding and target gene transcription. We find that T cell activation is impaired in arginine-depleted conditions, with significant metabolic perturbation linked to incomplete chromatin remodeling and misregulation of key genes. Our results highlight a T cell behavior mediated by nutritional stress, exploited by cancer cells to enable pathological immune evasion."

This study probed into the function of USP21 in vitro and in vivo, and discussed the regulatory mechanism of USP21 in GC in vitro. We reported that USP21 promoted GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness in vitro, and regulated GC tumor growth and cell stemness in mice in vivo. USP21 stabilized the expression of GATA3 by binding to GATA3. Besides, GATA3 also regulated the expression of MAPK1 at the transcriptional level. A series of in vitro experiments testified that USP21 regulated the expression of MAPK1 by binding to transcription factor GATA3, thereby regulating the tumor growth and cell stemness of GC. Overall, this study identified a new USP21/GATA3/MAPK1 axis, which plays a pivotal role in promoting the malignant progression of GC and might provide a potential target for treatment."

To date, over 170 diverse types of chemical modifications have been identified upon RNA nucleobases. Some of these post-synthesized modifications can be reversibly installed, removed, and decoded by their specific cellular components and play critical roles in different biological processes. Accordingly, dysregulation of RNA modification effectors is tightly orchestrated with developmental processes. Here, we particularly focus on three well-studied RNA modifications, including N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C), and N-1-methyladenosine (m(1)A), and summarize recent knowledge of underlying mechanisms and critical roles of these RNA modifications in stem cell fate determination, embryonic development, and cancer progression, providing a better understanding of the whole association between epitranscriptomic regulation and mammalian development."

However, the potential remodeling mechanisms of tumor metabolism in the immune microenvironment of CC remain largely unknown. In this study, we first performed microarray analysis to identify differential metabolic gene expression. A novel 5-metabolic-related genes (MRGs) signature comprising P4HA1, P4HA2, ABL2, GLTP, and CYP4F12 was established to better predict prognosis of CC using LASSO-Cox regression analysis. This signature could reveal the metabolic features and monitor the immune status of tumor microenvironment (TME). Among them, P4HA2 was significantly upregulated in CC tissues and negatively correlated with CD8+T cells. Knockdown of P4HA2 inhibited lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation and cancer cells invasion. Moreover, P4HA2 knockdown significantly suppressed PD-L1 expression. This study provides a new and feasible method for evaluating the prognosis of CC and explores the potential value to navigate metabolic pathways to enhance anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy."

Excision of mutagenic replication-blocking lesions suppresses cancer but promotes cytotoxicity and lethality in nitrosamine-exposed mice	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							METHYLPURINE-DNA GLYCOSYLASE; HISTONE H2AX PHOSPHORYLATION; HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION; CHROMOSOMAL-ABERRATIONS; CELL-CYCLE; N-NITROSODIMETHYLAMINE; MUTANT FREQUENCIES; MUTATION SPECTRA; DAMAGE RESPONSE; REPAIR ACTIVITY	"N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a DNA-methylating agent that has been discovered to contaminate water, food, and drugs. The alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) removes methylated bases to initiate the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To understand how gene-environment interactions impact disease susceptibility, we study Aag-knockout (Aag(-/-)) and Aag-overexpressing mice that harbor increased levels of either replication-blocking lesions (3-methyladenine [3MeA]) or strand breaks (BER intermediates), respectively. Remarkably, the disease outcome switches from cancer to lethality simply by changing AAG levels. To understand the underlying basis for this observation, we integrate a suite of molecular, cellular, and physiological analyses. We find that unrepaired 3MeA is somewhat toxic, but highly mutagenic (promoting cancer), whereas excess strand breaks are poorly mutagenic and highly toxic (suppressing cancer and promoting lethality). We demonstrate that the levels of a single DNA repair protein tip the balance between blocks and breaks and thus dictate the disease consequences of DNA damage."

AQPs are overexpressed in several cancers. Especially in breast cancer, AQP5 overexpression correlates with spread to lymph nodes and poor prognosis. Previously, we showed that AQP5 expression reduced cell-cell adhesion by reducing levels of adherens and tight-junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1, plakoglobin, and beta-catenin) at the actual junctions. Here, we show that, when targeted to the plasma membrane, the AQP5 COOH-terminal tail domain regulated junctional proteins and, moreover, that AQP5 interacted with ZO-1, plakoglobin, beta-catenin, and desmoglein-2, which were all reduced at junctions upon AQP5 overexpression. Thus, our data suggest that AQP5 mediates the effect on cell-cell adhesion via interactions with junctional proteins independently of AQP5-mediated water transport. AQP5 overexpression in cancers may thus contribute to carcinogenesis and cancer spread by two independent mechanisms: reduced cell?cell adhesion, a characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and increased cell migration capacity via water transport."

Here, we describe the use of deep neural networks to analyze this relationship, demonstrating that complex cell morphologies can encode states of signaling networks and unravel cellular mechanisms hidden to conventional approaches. We perform high-content screening of 17 cancer cell lines, generating more than 500 billion data points from similar to 850 million cells. We analyze these data using a deep learning model, resulting in the identification of a continuous 27-dimension space describing all of the observed cell morphologies. From its morphology alone, we could thus predict whether a cell was resistant to ErbB-family drugs, with an accuracy of 74%, and predict the potential mechanism of resistance, subsequently validating the role of MET and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) as drivers of cetuximab resistance in in vitro models of lung and head/neck cancer."

We found that chromosome oscillation, an iterative chromosome motion during metaphase, is attenuated in cancer cell lines. We also found that metaphase phosphorylation of Hec1 at serine 55, which is mainly dependent on Aurora A on the spindle, is reduced in cancer cell lines. The Aurora A-dependent Hec1-S55 phosphorylation level was regulated by the chromosome oscillation amplitude and vice versa: Hec1-S55 and -S69 phosphorylation by Aurora A is required for efficient chromosome oscillation. Furthermore, enhancement of chromosome oscillation reduced the number of erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments and chromosome missegregation, whereas inhibition of Aurora A during metaphase increased such errors. We propose that Aurora A-mediated metaphase Hec1-S55 phosphorylation through chromosome oscillation, together with Hec1-S69 phosphorylation, ensures mitotic fidelity by eliminating erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Attenuated chromosome oscillation and the resulting reduced Hec1-S55 phosphorylation may be a cause of CIN in cancer cell lines."

This study aimed to explore the role of RNF19A, as well as the underlying potential mechanism, in the development of NSCLC. Here, we found that RNF19A was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues, and RNF19A expression in NSCLC tissue samples was associated with NSCLC carcinogenesis and poor outcome. RNF19A promoted the proliferation of NSCLC cells and inhibited apoptosis. RNF19A reduced p53, p21 and BAX expression and induced Cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6 and BCL2 expression. The inhibitory effect of RNF19A knockdown on proliferation was partially rescued by p53 silencing. RNF19A interacted with p53, shortened p53 half-life and mediated p53 ubiquitin-degradation. Collectively, we suggest that RNF19A plays a critical oncogenic role in lung carcinogenesis by disrupting the function of p53. RNF19A may serve as a new biomarker and/or target for NSCLC management."

Not only TCF-1 can modulate the T cell development but also exerts various effects on the differentiation and function of mature CD8(+) T cells. In addition, it drives the production and maintenance of the immune response of CD8(+) T cells after PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy. TCF-1 can serve as a potential target of immunotherapy and may provide promising novel treatment strategies for patients with cancer and infections. Moreover, TCF-1 is a potential biomarker of CD8(+) T cell functionality to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy in fighting against cancer and infections. Herein, we summarize the role of TCF-1 in T cell development and its applications in the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases."

Liver x receptor alpha drives chemoresistance in response to side-chain hydroxycholesterols in triple negative breast cancer	ONCOGENE			English	Article								"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is challenging to treat successfully because targeted therapies do not exist. Instead, systemic therapy is typically restricted to cytotoxic chemotherapy, which fails more often in patients with elevated circulating cholesterol. Liver x receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are homeostatic regulators of cholesterol, and are linked to regulation of broad-affinity xenobiotic transporter activity in non-tumor tissues. We show that LXR ligands confer chemotherapy resistance in TNBC cell lines and xenografts, and that LXRalpha is necessary and sufficient to mediate this resistance. Furthermore, in TNBC patients who had cancer recurrences, LXRalpha and ligands were independent markers of poor prognosis and correlated with P-glycoprotein expression. However, in patients who survived their disease, LXRalpha signaling and P-glycoprotein were decoupled. These data reveal a novel chemotherapy resistance mechanism in this poor prognosis subtype of breast cancer. We conclude that systemic chemotherapy failure in some TNBC patients is caused by co-opting the LXRalpha:P-glycoprotein axis, a pathway highly targetable by therapies that are already used for prevention and treatment of other diseases."

Blood cancers known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are thought to originate when a driver mutation is acquired by a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). However, when the mutation first occurs in individuals and how it affects the behavior of HSCs in their native context is not known. Here we quantified the effect of the JAK2-V617F mutation on the self-renewal and differentiation dynamics of HSCs in treatment-naive individuals with MPNs and reconstructed lineage histories of individual HSCs using somatic mutation patterns. We found that JAK2-V617F mutations occurred in a single HSC several decades before MPN diagnosis-at age 9 +/- 2 years in a 34-year-old individual and at age 19 +/- 3 years in a 63-year-old individual-and found that mutant HSCs have a selective advantage in both individuals. These results highlight the potential of harnessing somatic mutations to reconstruct cancer lineages."

PTHrP increased the protein expression of SPARC, a factor involved in EMT, in HCT116 cells but not in Caco-2 cells also from CRC but with less aggressiveness. PTHrP also increased SPARC expression and its subsequent release from endothelial HMEC-1 cells. The conditioned media of PTHrP-treated HMEC-1 cells induced early changes related to EMT in HCT116 cells. Moreover, SPARC treatment on HCT116 cells potentiated PTHrP modulation in E-cadherin expression and cell migration. In vivo PTHrP also increased SPARC expression and decreased E-cadherin expression.

We identify the SOX4 transcription factor as an important resistance mechanism to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity for TNBC cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that inactivation of SOX4 in tumor cells increases the expression of genes in a number of innate and adaptive immune pathways important for protective tumor immunity. Expression of SOX4 is regulated by the integrin alpha v beta 6 receptor on the surface of tumor cells, which activates TGF beta from a latent precursor. An integrin alpha v beta 6/8-blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibits SOX4 expression and sensitizes TNBC cells to cytotoxic T cells. This integrin mAb induces a substantial survival benefit in highly metastatic murine TNBC models poorly responsive to PD-1 blockade. Targeting of the integrin alpha v beta 6-TGF beta-SOX4 pathway therefore provides therapeutic opportunities for TNBC and other highly aggressive human cancers of epithelial origin."

Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an aggressive cancer characterized by biallelic inactivation of the gene encoding the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase, an early shift to aerobic glycolysis, and rapid metastasis. We observed impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumors from patients with HLRCC. Biochemical and transcriptomic analyses revealed that respiratory chain dysfunction in the tumors was due to loss of expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes, caused by a marked decrease in mtDNA content and increased mtDNA mutations. We demonstrated that accumulation of fumarate in HLRCC tumors inactivated the core factors responsible for replication and proofreading of mtDNA, leading to loss of respiratory chain components, thereby promoting the shift to aerobic glycolysis and disease progression in this prototypic model of glucose-dependent human cancer."

The human P2X7 gene is highly polymorphic, and several splice variants of the receptor have been identified in time. P2X7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been broadly analyzed by studies relating them to pathologies as different as infectious, inflammatory, nervous, and bone diseases, among which cancer is included. Moreover, in the last years, an increasing number of reports concentrated on P2X7 splice variants' different roles and their implications in pathological conditions, including oncogenesis. Here, we give an overview of established and recent literature demonstrating a role for human P2X7 gene products in oncological conditions, mainly focusing on current data emerging on P2X7 isoform B and nfP2X7. We explored the role of these and other genetic variants of P2X7 in cancer insurgence, dissemination, and progression, as well as the effect of chemotherapy on isoforms expression. The described literature strongly suggests that P2X7 variants are potential new biomarkers and therapeutical targets in oncological conditions and that their study in carcinogenesis deserves to be further pursued."

Circadian rhythm disruption has been associated with immune suppression which leads to higher cancer risk, suggesting a putative tumor protective role of circadian clock homeostasis. CBX4, as an epigenetic regulator, has been explored for its involvement in tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the correlation between CBX4 and circadian rhythm disruption in colon cancer as well as the potential impact on the tumor immunity. A significant upregulation of CBX4 was identified in the TCGA colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) samples when compared with the normal controls (p < 0.001). This differential expression was confirmed at the protein level using colon adenocarcinoma tissue array (p < 0.01). CBX4 was up-regulated in the recurred/progressed colon cancer cases compared with the disease-free samples (p < 0.01), suggesting CBX4 as a potential predictor for poor prognosis. With regard to nodular metastasis, CBX4 was found to be associated with early onset of metastatic diseases but not late progression. The circadian rhythm is orchestrated by the alternating activation and suppression of the CLOCK/ARNTL-driven positive loop and the PER/CRY-controlled negative loop. In COAD, CBX4 was negatively correlated with CLOCK (p < 0.001), and positively correlated with PER1 (p < 0.001), PER3 (p < 0.01), and CRY2 (p < 0.001) as well as NR1D1 (p < 0.001), a critical negative regulator of the circadian clock. These interactions consistently impacted on patient survival based on the colorectal cancer cohorts GSE17536 and GSE14333 of PrognoScan. CBX4 showed significant negative correlations with infiltrating B cells (p < 0.05) and CD4(+) T cells (p < 0.01), and positive correlations with myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (p < 0.05) and cancer associated fibroblast (CAFs) (p < 0.001), as well as a low immunoscore. Moreover, CBX4 displayed significant correlations with diverse immune metagenes. PER1 and PER3, consistent with their coordinated expression with CBX4, also had strong correlations with these gene representatives in COAD, suggesting a potential interaction of CBX4 with the circadian machinery. Our studies implicate that CBX4 may contribute to colon cancer development via potential influence on circadian rhythm and immune infiltration. These findings provide new insights into deciphering the function of CBX4, and may contribute to the development of new targeting strategies."

However, although extensive studies from multiple aspects have been conducted regarding treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), there are still no effective ICB-based therapies or biomarkers for this cancer type. A series of our studies have identified that the small GTPase ARF6 and its downstream effector AMAP1 (also called ASAP1/DDEF1) are often overexpressed in different cancers, including PDAC, and closely correlate with poor patient survival. Mechanistically, the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway drives cancer cell invasion and immune evasion, via upregulating beta 1-integrins and PD-L1, and downregulating E-cadherin, upon ARF6 activation by external ligands. Moreover, the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway enhances the fibrosis caused by PDAC, which is another barrier for ICB therapies. KRAS mutations are prevalent in PDACs. We have shown previously that oncogenic KRAS mutations are the major cause of the aberrant overexpression of ARF6 and AMAP1, in which KRAS signaling enhances eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent ARF6 mRNA translation and eIF4E-dependent AMAP1 mRNA translation. MYC overexpression is also a key pathway in driving cancer malignancy. MYC mRNA is also known to be under the control of eIF4A, and the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol suppresses MYC and ARF6 expression. Using a KPC mouse model of human PDAC (LSL-Kras(G12D/+); LSL-Trp53(R172H/+)); Pdx-1-Cre), we here demonstrate that inhibition of the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway by shRNAs in cancer cells results in therapeutic synergy with an anti-PD-1 antibody in vivo; and furthermore, that silvestrol improves the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, whereas silvestrol on its own promotes tumor growth in vivo. ARF6 and MYC are both essential for normal cell functions. We demonstrate that silvestrol substantially mitigates the overexpression of ARF6 and MYC in KRAS-mutated cells, whereas the suppression is moderate in KRAS-intact cells. We propose that targeting eIF4A, as well as mutant KRAS, provides novel methods to improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and associated ICB therapies against PDACs, in which ARF6 and AMAP1 overexpression, as well as KRAS mutations of cancer cells are biomarkers to identify patients with drug-susceptible disease. The same may be applicable to other cancers with KRAS mutations."

Long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) PVT1 is an overexpressed oncogene that is associated with AR in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and with PRC2 in HeLa and many other types of cancer cells. The possible involvement of PVT1 in mediating androgen-induced gene expression downregulation in prostate cancer has not been explored. Methods LNCaP cell line was used. Native RNA-binding-protein immunoprecipitation with anti-AR or anti-EZH2 was followed by RT-qPCR with primers for PVT1. Knockdown of PVT1 with specific GapmeRs (or a control with scrambled GapmeR) was followed by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) determination with Agilent microarrays and with Significance Analysis of Microarrays statistical test. DEGs were tested as a tumor risk classifier with a machine learning Random Forest algorithm run with gene expression data from all TCGA-PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) tumors as input. ChIP-qPCR was performed for histone marks at the promoter of one DEG. Results We show that PVT1 knockdown in androgen-stimulated LNCaP cells caused statistically significant expression upregulation/downregulation of hundreds of genes. Interestingly, PVT1 knockdown caused upregulation of 160 genes that were repressed by androgen, including a significantly enriched set of tumor suppressor genes, and among them FAS, NOV/CCN3, BMF, HRK, IFIT2, AJUBA, DRAIC and TNFRSF21. A 121-gene-set (out of the 160) was able to correctly predict the classification of all 293 intermediate- and high-risk TCGA-PRAD tumors, with a mean ROC area under the curve AUC = 0.89 +/- 0.04, pointing to the relevance of these genes in cancer aggressiveness. Native RIP-qPCR in LNCaP showed that PVT1 was associated with EZH2, a component of PRC2. PVT1 knockdown followed by ChIP-qPCR showed significant epigenetic remodeling at the enhancer and promoter regions of tumor suppressor gene NOV, one of the androgen-repressed genes that were upregulated upon PVT1 silencing. Conclusions Overall, we provide first evidence that PVT1 was involved in signaling a genome-wide androgen-dependent transcriptional repressive program of tumor suppressor protein-coding genes in prostate cancer cells. Identification of transcriptional inhibition of tumor suppressor genes by PVT1 highlights the pathway to the investigation of mechanisms that lie behind the oncogenic role of PVT1 in cancer."

Altered cell metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and changes in nutrient pools and fluxes are important components of the bidirectional communication between MSCs and hematological cancer cells. Among nutrients, amino acids play a significant role in cancer progression and chemo-resistance. Moreover, selected types of cancer cells are extremely greedy for glutamine, and significantly deplete the extracellular pool of the amino acid. As a consequence, this influences the behavior of MSCs in terms of either cytokine/chemokine secretion or differentiation potential. Additionally, a direct nutritional interaction exists between MSCs and immune cells. In particular, selected subpopulations of lymphocytes are dependent upon selected amino acids, such as arginine and tryptophan, for full differentiation and competence. This review describes and discusses the nutritional interactions existing in the neoplastic bone marrow niche between MSCs and other cell types, with a particular emphasis on cancer cells and immune cells. These relationships are discussed in the perspective of potential novel therapeutic strategies based on the interference on amino acid metabolism or intercellular fluxes."

However, the overall response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for many cancers is only between 20 and 40%, and even less for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient immunotherapeutic strategy for CRC. Here, we developed a novel CRC combination therapy consisting of a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Foretinib) and anti-PD-1 antibody. The combination therapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice, led to improved tumor regression without relapse (83% for CT26 tumors and 50% for MC38 tumors) and prolonged overall survival. Mechanistically, Foretinib caused increased levels of PD-L1 via activating the JAK2-STAT1 pathway, which could improve the effectiveness of the immune checkpoint inhibitor. Moreover, the combination therapy remodeled the tumor microenvironment and enhanced anti-tumor immunity by further increasing the infiltration and improving the function of T cells, decreasing the percentage of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and inhibiting their polarization toward the M2 phenotype. Furthermore, the combination therapy inhibited the metastasis of CT26-Luc tumors to the lung in BALB/c mouse by reducing proportions of regulatory T-cells, TAMs and M2 phenotype TAMs in their lungs. This study suggests that a novel combination therapy utilizing both Foretinib and anti-PD-1 antibody could be an effective combination strategy for CRC immunotherapy."

Alternative splicing (AS) is a determinant of gene expression and contributes to protein diversity from a rather limited gene transcript in metazoans. AS events are associated with different aspects of cancer biology, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, etc. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the prognostic AS profile GC. GC-specific AS (GCAS) events were analyzed, and overall survival-associated GCAS (OS-GCAS) events were verified among the genome-wide AS events identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In total, 1,287 GCAS events of 837 genes and 173 OS-GCAS events of 130 genes were identified. The parental genes of OS-GCAS events were significantly enriched in the development of GC. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and OSGCAS-associated splicing factor (SF) interaction networks were constructed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty was performed to establish a prognostic risk formula, representing 23 OS-GCAS events. The low-risk group had better OS than the high-risk group and lower immune and stromal scores.

Whereas up-regulation of innate immune/interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is implicated in cancer progression, G4-forming oligonucleotides that mimic telomeric repeat-containing RNA suppress ISG induction in three-dimensional (3D) culture of cancer cells. However, it is unclear how G4 suppresses ISG expression in trans. In this study, we found that G4 binding to splicing factor 3B subunit 2 (SF3B2) down-regulated STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression in 3D-cultured cancer cells. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified SF3B2 as a G4-binding protein. Either G4-forming oligonucleotides or SF3B2 knockdown suppressed ISG induction, whereas Phen-DC3, a G4-stabilizing compound, reversed the inhibitory effect of G4-forming oligonucleotides on ISG induction. Phen-DC3 inhibited SF3B2 binding to G4 in vitro. SF3B2-mediated ISG induction appeared to occur independently of RNA splicing because SF3B2 knockdown did not affect pre-mRNA splicing under the experimental conditions, and pharmacological inhibition of splicing by pladienolide B did not repress ISG induction. These observations suggest that G4 disrupts the ability of SF3B2 to induce ISGs in cancer. We propose a new mode for gene regulation, which employs G4 as an inhibitory trans-element."

Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a representative pro-resolving lipid mediator that is endogenously generated from docosahexaenoic acid for the resolution of inflammation. Here, we report a decreased level of RvD1 in the blood from colorectal cancer patients and mice having inflammation-induced colon cancer, suggesting plasma RvD1 as a potential biomarker for monitoring colorectal cancer. Administration of RvD1 attenuated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane (AOM) plus DSS-induced colorectal carcinogenesis by suppressing the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6-mediated chromosomal instability. The protective effect of RvD1 against chromosomal instability is associated with downregulation of IL-6-induced Cyclin D1 expression, which appears to be mediated by blocking the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) axis. RvD1 inhibited the STAT3 signaling pathway by interfering with the binding of IL-6 to its receptor (IL-6R), suggesting the novel function of RvD1 as a putative IL-6R antagonist. Together, our findings suggest that RvD1-mediated blockade of IL-6 signal transmission may contribute to inhibition of chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis."

Since the majority of cancer-related deaths are associated with late diagnosis, it is necessary to develop minimally invasive early detection markers to manage and reduce mortality rates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as highly conserved non-coding RNAs, target the specific mRNAs which are involved in regulation of various fundamental cellular processes such as cell proliferation, death, and signaling pathways. MiRNAs can also be regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). They are highly stable in body fluids and have tumor-specific expression profiles, which suggest their suitability as efficient non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tumor markers. Aberrant expression of miR-338 has been widely reported in different cancers. It regulates cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in tumor cells. Main body In the present review, we have summarized all miR-338 interactions with other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and associated signaling pathways to clarify the role of miR-338 during tumor progression. Conclusions It was concluded that miR-338 mainly functions as a tumor suppressor in different cancers. There were also significant associations between miR-338 and other ncRNAs in tumor cells. Moreover, miR-338 has a pivotal role during tumor progression using the regulation of WNT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. This review highlights miR-338 as a pivotal ncRNA in biology of tumor cells."

However, Phosphoproteome landscapes of GOLM1 overexpression in lung cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and phosphoproteome, we systematically evaluated the feature of GOLM1 and studied its prognostic value in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities in PC9 cell with GOLM1 overexpression were determined using Trans-well system assay. Tumor engrafts was visualized in mice models and confirmed by ex vivo. An increased expression of GOLM1 had shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with NSCLC in TCGA database. GOLM1 in single gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) related to adherent's junction, cell cycle, and pathway in cancer. Overexpression of GOLM1 in GOLM1OE PC9 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Decreased migration and invasion potential were also observed in knockdown of GOLM1 in GOLM1KD PC9 cells in migration assay. An increased expression of GOLM1 could significantly increase the growth of tumor in xenograft mice models. phosphoproteome analysis showed 239 upregulated and 331 downregulated Phosphorylated proteins in GOLM1OE PC9 cells. Overexpression of GOLM1 in GSEA was significantly related to P53 in MAPK signaling pathway. Overexpression of GOLM1enhanced the phosphorylation of P53 protein at site S315 but inhibited the formation of P53 tetramers. These results indicate that overexpression GOLM1 enhances non-small-cell carcinoma aggressiveness through inhibited the formation of P53 tetramer."

It is largely unknown whether the restoration of functional PTEN may modulate the TME and improve the tumor's sensitivity to ICB therapy. Here, we demonstrate that mRNA delivery by polymeric nanoparticles can effectively induce expression of PTEN in Pten-mutated melanoma cells and Pten-null prostate cancer cells, which in turn induces autophagy and triggers cell death-associated immune activation via release of damage-associated molecular patterns. In vivo results illustrated that PTEN mRNA nanoparticles can reverse the immunosuppressive TME by promoting CD8(+) T cell infiltration of the tumor tissue, enhancing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma, and reducing regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The combination of PTEN mRNA nanoparticles with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-programmed death-1 antibody, results in a highly potent antitumor effect in a subcutaneous model of Pten-mutated melanoma and an orthotopic model of Pten-null prostate cancer. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment elicits immunological memory in the Pten-null prostate cancer model."

Approximately, 80% of patients with BC will present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), whereas a quarter will have muscle invasive disease (MIBC) at the time of BC diagnosis. However, patients with NMIBC are at risk of BC recurrence or progression into MIBC, and an MIBC prognosis is determined by the presence of progression and metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a type of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), plays a major role in tumour invasion and is well-characterized in BC prognosis. In BC, the mechanisms regulating MMP2 expression, and, in turn, promote cancer invasion, have hardly been explored. Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4/TSP4) is a matricellular glycoprotein that regulates multiple biological functions, including proliferation, angiogenesis, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix modelling. Based on the results of a meta-analysis in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 database, we observed that TSP4 expression levels were consistent with overall survival (OS) rate and BC progression, with the highest expression levels observed in the advanced stages of BC and associated with poor OS rate. In our pilot experiments, incubation with recombinant TSP4 promoted the migration and invasion in BC cells. Furthermore, MMP2 expression levels increased after recombinant TSP4 incubation. TSP4-induced-MMP2 expression and cell motility were regulated via the AKT signalling pathway. Our findings facilitate further investigation into TSP4 silencing-based therapeutic strategies for BC."

Method: In this randomized non-comparative phase II trial, 92 patients with localized prostate cancer were assigned to receive either hypofractionated IG-VMAT (HFRT; 70 Gy/2.5Gy/28f) or conventionally fractionated IG-VMAT (CFRT; 80 Gy/2Gy/40f). Primary endpoint was grade 2 or higher late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity at 2 years. The GI/GU toxicity and biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) were compared between the two treatment groups. Results: Median follow-up was 26 months. The incidence of grade 2 or higher late GI/GU toxicity was low in both groups; the 5-year cumulative incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 2 or higher GI/GU toxicity at 2 years was 7.6% with HFRT versus 10.3% with CFRT (P = 0.707). Biochemical control was not significantly different between the two groups; the 2-year bRFS was 94.6% for HFRT versus 95.0% for CFRT (P = 0.704). Conclusion: Hypofractionated IG-VMAT appears to be equivalent to conventionally fractionated IG-VMAT in terms of toxicity in Chinese patients with localized prostate cancer."

USP22 was identified as a member of the so-called death-from-cancer signature predicting therapy failure in cancer patients. However, the importance and functional role of USP22 in different types and subtypes of cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we leveraged human cell lines and genetic mouse models to investigate the role of USP22 in HER2-driven breast cancer (HER2(+)-BC) and demonstrate for the first time that USP22 is required for the tumorigenic properties in murine and human HER2(+)-BC models. To get insight into the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcriptome-wide gene expression analyses and identified the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) as a pathway deregulated upon USP22 loss. The UPR is normally induced upon extrinsic or intrinsic stresses that can promote cell survival and recovery if shortly activated or programmed cell death if activated for an extended period. Strikingly, we found that USP22 actively suppresses UPR induction in HER2(+)-BC cells by stabilizing the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone HSPA5. Consistently, loss of USP22 renders tumor cells more sensitive to apoptosis and significantly increases the efficiency of therapies targeting the ER folding capacity. Together, our data suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting USP22 activity may sensitize tumor cells to UPR induction and could provide a novel, effective approach to treat HER2(+)-BC."

However, few studies have investigated the effects of phytoestrogens on vascular endothelial cells (ECs). In the present study, we show that the phytoestrogen calycosin (20 ?M) stimulated the proliferation of ECs (HUVECs and HMEC-1) but inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells (BCCs) expressing ER? (MCF-7 and T47D). Here we provide evidence for the presence of a positive feedback loop between ER? and long noncoding RNA RP11-65M17.3 in both normal and cancer cells, and calycosin stimulated this feedback loop in ECs but decreased RP11-65M17.3 expression in BCCs. Subsequently, the calycosin-induced activation of this loop decreased the expression of the target of BRIP1 (BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1), increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, and finally inhibited the cleavage of PARP-1 in ECs. In nude mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts, calycosin did not stimulate tumor growth as strongly as 17?-estradiol. Together, these results suggest that calycosin promotes the proliferation of ECs, and notable inhibits the growth of BCCs. A possible reason for these results is the involvement of a feedback loop between ER? and RP11-65M17.3."

However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of CaM/CaMKs on the survival capability of liver cancer cells is unclear, and this study investigates this mechanism in apicidin-persistent HA22T cells. CaM level was upregulated, especially in the cytosol, in apicidin-persistent HA22T cells than in parental HA22T cells and was positively associated with cell proliferation and migration capacity of apicidin-persistent HA22T cells. Further, the expression of CaM-activated CaMKs-dependent signaling cascades, including CaMKK2, CaMKIV, CaMKII-gamma, and p-CaMKII was observed in apicidin-persistent HA22T cells, which were transiently activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase oncogenic signaling, such as CREB, ERK1/2, and c-fos. Furthermore, a specific CaM inhibitor trifluoperazine reduced the levels of p-CREB, p-ERK1/2, and c-fos in apicidin-persistent HA22T cells than in parental HA22T cells. Additionally, inhibition of CaM also suppressed CaM-induced Bcl-XL (an antiapoptotic protein) expression in apicidin-persistent HA22T cells. Our finding emphasizes an essential role of CaM/CaMKs in augmentation of the survival capability of apicidin-persistent liver cancer cells and suggests that CaM inhibition significantly attenuates CaM-induced tumor growth and abrogates antiapoptotic function and also offers a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment."

For these reasons, it is imperative to find novel therapeutic agents that overcome these factors. To this end, we explored a cationic antimicrobial peptide derived from Litopenaeus vannamei hemocyanin (designated LvHemB1) that induces cancer cell death, but sparing normal cells. LvHemB1 inhibits the proliferation of human cervical (HeLa), esophageal (EC109), hepatocellular (HepG2), and bladder (EJ) cancer cell lines, but had no significant effect on normal liver cell lines (T-antigen-immortalized human liver epithelial (THLE-3) cells). In addition to its antiproliferative effects, LvHemB1 induced apoptosis, by permeating cells and targeting mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). Colocalization studies revealed the localization of LvHemB1 in mitochondria, while molecular docking and pull-down analyses confirmed LvHemB1-VDAC1 interaction. Moreover, LvHemB1 causes loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and increases levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic proteins (caspase-9, caspase-3, and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X)), which results in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Thus, peptide LvHemB1 has the potential of being used as an anticancer agent due to its antiproliferation effect and targeting to VDAC1 to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells, as well as its ability to induce apoptosis by increasing ROS levels, and the expression of proapoptotic proteins."

Additional treatment targets that may enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs remain elusive. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identified the leucine-rich repeat scaffold protein SHOC2 as a key modulator of sensitivity to EGFR-TKI treatment. On the basis of in vitro assays, we demonstrated that SHOC2 expression levels strongly correlate with the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs and that SHOC2 affects the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cells via SHOC2/MRAS/PP1c and SHOC2/SCRIB signaling. The potential SHOC2 inhibitor celastrol phenocopied SHOC2 depletion. In addition, we confirmed that SHOC2 expression levels were important for the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in vivo. Furthermore, IHC showed the accumulation of cancer cells that express high levels of SHOC2 in lung cancer tissues obtained from patients with NSCLC who experienced acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. These data indicate that SHOC2 may be a therapeutic target for patients with NSCLC or a biomarker to predict sensitivity to EGFR-TKI therapy in EGFR mutation-positive patients with NSCLC. Our findings may help improve treatment strategies for patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations."

APC regulation of ESRP1 and p120-catenin isoforms in colorectal cancer cells	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL			English	Article							EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; P120 CATENIN; ADHERENS JUNCTIONS; PANCREATIC-CANCER; E-CADHERIN; ADHESION; PROTEIN; DIFFERENTIATION; RESTORATION; INHIBITION	"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein is associated with the regulation of Wnt signaling; however, APC also controls other cellular processes including the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. The expression of full-length APC in SW480 colorectal cancer cells (SW480+APC) not only reduces Wnt signaling, but increases membrane E-cadherin and restores cell-cell adhesion. This report describes the effects of full-length, wild-type APC (fl-APC) on cell-cell adhesion genes and p120-catenin isoform switching in SW480 colon cancer cells: fl-APC increased the expression of genes implicated in cell-cell adhesion, whereas the expression of negative regulators of E-cadherin was decreased. Analysis of cell-cell adhesion-related proteins in SW480+APC cells revealed an increase in p120-catenin isoform 3A; similarly, depletion of APC altered the p120-catenin protein isoform profile. Expression of ESRP1 (epithelial splice regulatory protein 1) is increased in SW480+APC cells, and its depletion results in reversion to the p120-catenin isoform 1A phenotype and reduced cell-cell adhesion. The ESRP1 transcript is reduced in primary colorectal cancer, and its expression correlates with the level of APC. Pyrvinium pamoate, which inhibits Wnt signaling, promotes ESRP1 expression. We conclude that re-expression of APC restores the cell-cell adhesion gene and posttranscriptional regulatory programs leading to p120-catenin isoform switching and associated changes in cell-cell adhesion."

Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) plays a key role in shaping Ca2+ signals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be potential therapeutic targets for many diseases, including breast cancer. Recently, we investigated the effect of exosomes from STIM1-knockout breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (Exo-STIM1-KO), and from SKF96365-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Exo-SKF) on angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and nude mice. The exosomes Exo-STIM1-KO and Exo-SKF inhibited tube formation by HUVECs remarkably. The miR-145 was increased in SKF96365 treated or STIM1-knockout MDA-MB-231 cells, Exo-SKF and Exo-STIM1-KO, and HUVECs treated with Exo-SKF or Exo-STIM1-KO. Moreover, the expressions of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), which is the target of miR-145, and the downstream proteins such as Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Raf/extracellular signal regulated-protein kinase (ERK), and p38 were markedly inhibited in HUVECs treated with Exo-SKF or Exo-STIM1-KO. Matrigel plug assay in vivo showed that tumor angiogenesis was suppressed in Exo-STIM1-KO, but promoted when miR-145 antagomir was added. Taken together, our findings suggest that STIM1 promotes angiogenesis by reducing exosomal miR-145 in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells."

"Terminal alpha 2,6-sialylation of epidermal growth factor receptor modulates antibody therapy response of colorectal cancer cells"	CELLULAR ONCOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						"Colorectal cancer; alpha 2,6-sialylation; Cetuximab; EGFR; ST6Gal1"		"Background The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key protein involved in cancer development. Monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR are approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite the beneficial clinical effects observed in subgroups of patients, the acquisition of resistance to treatment remains a major concern. Protein N-glycosylation of cellular receptors is known to regulate physiological processes leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways. In the present study, the role of EGFR-specific terminal alpha 2,6-sialylation was analyzed in modulation of the malignant phenotype of CRC cells and their resistance to monoclonal antibody Cetuximab-based therapy. Methods Glycoengineered CRC cell models with specific sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 expression levels were applied to evaluate EGFR activation, cell surface glycosylation and therapeutic response to Cetuximab. Results Glycoproteomic analysis revealed EGFR as a major target of ST6Gal1-mediated alpha 2,6-sialylation in a glycosite-specific manner. Mechanistically, CRC cells with increased ST6Gal1 expression and displaying terminal alpha 2,6-sialylation showed a marked resistance to Cetuximab-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, we found that this resistance was accompanied by downregulation of EGFR expression and its activation. Conclusions Our data indicate that EGFR alpha 2,6-sialylation is a key factor in modulating the susceptibility of CRC cells to antibody targeted therapy, thereby disclosing a potential novel biomarker and providing key molecular information for tailor made anti-cancer strategies."

Stem cells have immunosuppressive properties that promote tumor targeting and circumvent obstacles currently in gene therapy. Bone marrow stem cells are believed to have anticancer potential. The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a type of bone marrow stem cells, has been considered a potential therapy for patients with solid tumors due to their capability to enhance the immune response; MSC transplantation has received renewed interest in recent years. The present study aimed to evaluate the antiapoptotic effects of the MSCs on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced inflammation in the rat model of colorectal cancer. The rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control, treated with MSCs, induced by DMH, and induced by DMH and treated with MSCs. The MSCs were intra-rectally injected, and DMH was subcutaneously injected at 20 mg/kg body weight once a week for 15 weeks. The administration of MSCs into rats starting from day 0 of the DMH injection was found to enhance the histopathological picture. The MSC treatment resulted in fewer inflammatory cells than in the DMH group. Therefore, our findings suggest that BMCs have antitumor effects by modulating the cellular redox status and down-regulating the pro-inflammatory genes. Thus, BMCs may provide therapeutic value for colon cancer treatment."

The tumor microenvironment is known to play a vital role in tumor information transmission and immune detection. Methods: In the present study, we examined gene expression data from 518 patients with PTC. The ESTIMATE algorithm was used to calculate immune and stromal scores of PTC patients. Based on a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, functional enrichment and overall survival analyses, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was identified as a core gene. We further investigated the roles of core genes of PTC in the tumor immune microenvironment using LinkedOmics, GSEA, and TIMER tools. Results: Immune, stromal and ESTIMATE scores were related to clinicopathological variables of patients with PTC, but not survival outcomes. Eight differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with survival outcome. In addition, immunochemical staining experiments revealed lower expression of CXCL10 in PTC than paracancerous tissues. GSEA pathway enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of CXCL10 in multiple cancer pathways. CXCL10 and related genes were enriched in pathways related to adaptive immune response, cellular defense response and regulation of innate immune response. Conclusion: The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in development of PTC and CXCL10 may serve as a novel target of precision therapy for this patient population."

To evaluate the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on vascular endothelial cells and clarify the mechanism of metastasis in TKI-resistant renal cancer, we studied the crosstalk between clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exosomes from ccRCC cells enhanced the expression of vascular permeability-related proteins. Compared with sensitive strains, exosomes from resistant strains significantly enhanced vascular endothelial permeability, induced tumor angiogenesis and enhanced tumor lung metastasis in nude mice. The expression of miR-549a is lower in TKI-resistant cells and exosomes, which enhanced the expression of HIF1 alpha in endothelial cells. In addition, TKI-resistant RCC cells reduced nuclear output of pre-miR-549a via the VEGFR2-ERK-XPO5 pathway, and reduced enrichment of mature miR-549a in cytoplasm, which in turn promoted HIF1 alpha expression in RCC, leading to increased VEGF secretion and further activated VEGFR2 to form a feedback effect. miR-549a played an important role in the metastasis of renal cancer and might serve as a blood biomarker for ccRCC metastasis and even had the potential of becoming a new drug to inhibit TKI-resistance."

TMPRSS2 and Neuropilin-1, the key components that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, are potential targets for treatment of COVID-19. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis on NRP1 and TMPRSS2 in lung to provide information for treating comorbidity of COVID-19 with lung cancer. NRP1 is widely expressed across all the human tissues while TMPRSS2 is expressed in a restricted pattern. High level of NRP1 associates with worse prognosis in multiple cancers, while high level of TMPRSS2 is associated with better survival of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Moreover, NRP1 positively correlates with the oncogenic Cancer Associated Fibroblast (CAF), macrophage and endothelial cells infiltration, negatively correlates with infiltration of CD8(+) T cell, the tumor killer cell in Lung Squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). TMPRSS2 shows negative correlation with the oncogenic events in LUAD. RNA-seq data show that NRP1 level is slightly decreased in peripheral blood of ICU admitted COVID-19 patients, unaltered in lung, while TMPRSS2 level is significantly decreased in lung of COVID-19 patients. Our analysis suggests NRP1 as a potential therapeutic target, while sets an alert on targeting TMPRSS2 for treating comorbidity of COVID-19 and lung cancers."

In this study, effect of glutamine on stemness and differentiation potential of bCSCs isolated from MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 were studied. We have shown that bCSCs differentiate into CD24(+) epithelial population under gln-deprivation and demonstrated increased expression of epithelial markers such as e-cadherin, claudin-1 and decreased expression of mesenchymal protein n-cadherin. MCF-7-bCSCs showed a decrease in EpCAM(high) population whereas MDAMB-231-bCSCs increased CD44(high) population in response to gln-deprivation. The expression of intracellular stem cell markers such sox-2, oct-4 and nanog showed a drastic decrease in gene expression under gln-deprived MDAMB-231-bCSCs. Finally, localization of beta-catenin in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells showed its accumulation in cytosol or perinuclear space reducing its efficiency to transcribe downstream genes. Conclusively, our study demonstrated that gln-deprivation induces differentiation of bCSCs into epithelial subtypes and also reduces stemness of bCSCs mediated by reduced nuclear localization of beta-catenin. It also suggests that basal and luminal bCSCs respond differentially towards changes in extracellular and intracellular gln. This study could significantly affect the gln targeting regimen of breast cancer therapeutics."

Therefore, we first examined whether the same mechanism operates in other breast cancer cells, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and refractory phenotype of breast cancer. We also investigated the mechanism by which DIF-1 suppresses p70(S6K) by focusing on the AMPK-mTORC1 system. We found that DIF-1 induces phosphorylation of AMPK and Raptor and dephosphorylation of p70(S6K) in multiple TNBC cell lines. Next, we examined whether AMPK-mediated inhibition of p70(S6K) leads to the suppression of proliferation and migration/infiltration of TNBC cells. DIF-1 significantly reduced the expression levels of cyclin D1 by suppressing the translation of STAT3 and strongly suppressed the expression levels of Snail, which led to the suppression of growth and motility, respectively. Finally, we investigated whether DIF-1 exerts anticancer effects on TNBC in vivo. Intragastric administration of DIF-1 suppressed tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis of 4T1-Luc cells injected into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. DIF-1 is expected to lead to the development of anticancer drugs, including anti-TNBC, by a novel mechanism."

Here we show that elevated ATAD3A expression is clinically associated with poor 5-year disease-free survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), especially high-risk CRC patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Our results indicated ATAD3A is significantly upregulated to reduce chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death. We found that knockdown of ATAD3A leads to dysregulation in protein processing for inducing ER stress by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In response to chemotherapy-induced ER stress, ATAD3A interacts with elevated GRP78 protein to assist protein folding and alleviate ER stress for cancer cell survival. This reduction of ER stress leads to reduce the surface exposure of calreticulin, which is the initiator of immunogenic cell death and antitumor immunity. However, silencing of ATAD3A enhances cell death, triggers the feasibility of chemotherapy-induced ER stress for antitumor immunity, increases infiltration of T lymphocytes and delays tumor regrowth in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, CRC patients with less ATAD3A have high density of CD45(+) intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and memory CD45RO(+) TILs. Taken together, our results suggest that pharmacologic targeting to ATAD3A might be a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance antitumor immunity for CRC patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy."

Cell counting Kit-8 assay, wound-healing assay, transwell assay were used to assess cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion. TUNEL and Annexin V-FITC assays were applied to evaluate cell apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to identify direct targets of miRNAs. The protein expression level was assessed by Western blot. The results indicated that miR-20b-5p was increased in radioresistant KYSE-150R cells compared with KYSE-150 cells, whereas miR-125a-5p was downregulated. MiR-20b-5p upregulation promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the EMT process, and decreased apoptosis by negatively regulating PTEN.

Integrin alpha v beta 3 is a plasma membrane structural protein linked to signal transduction pathways that are critical to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Thyroid hormones, T-4 and to a less extend T-3 bind cell surface integrin alpha v beta 3, to stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway to stimulate cancer cell growth. Thyroid hormone analogues also engage in crosstalk with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Ras pathway. EGFR signal generation and, downstream, transduction of Ras/Raf pathway signals contribute importantly to tumor cell progression. Mutated Ras oncogenes contribute to chemoresistance in colorectal carcinoma (CRC); chemoresistance may depend in part on the activity of ERK1/2 pathway. In this review, we evaluate the contribution of thyroxine interacting with integrin alpha v beta 3 and crosstalking with EGFR/Ras signaling pathway non-genomically in CRC proliferation. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), the deaminated analogue of T-4, and its nano-derivative, NDAT, have anticancer functions, with effectiveness against CRC and other tumors. In Ras-mutant CRC cells, tetrac derivatives may overcome chemoresistance to other drugs via actions initiated at integrin alpha v beta 3 and involving, downstream, the EGFR-Ras signaling pathways."

We analyzed Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSet micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) profiling datasets to identify miRNAs that could have value as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We adopted several computing methods to identify the functional roles of these miRNAs. Ultimately, via integrated analysis of three GEO DataSets, three differential miRNAs were identified as valuable markers in HCC. Combining the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and Kaplan-Meier Plotter (KM) survival analyses, we identified hsa-let-7e as a novel potential biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. Then, we found via quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) that let-7e was upregulated in HCC tissues and that such upregulation was significantly associated with poor prognosis in HCC. The results of functional analysis indicated that upregulated let-7e promoted tumor cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, via mechanistic analysis, we found that let-7e could regulate mitochondrial apoptosis and autophagy to adjust and control cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, the integrated results of our bioinformatics analyses of both clinical and experimental data showed that let-7e was a novel biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis and might be a new treatment target."

Here, we show that this proton leak across Golgi membranes is mediated by the AE2a (SLC4A2a)-mediated bicarbonate-chloride exchange, as it is strictly dependent on bicarbonate import (in exchange for chloride export) and the expression level of the Golgi-localized AE2a anion exchanger. In the acidic Golgi lumen, imported bicarbonate anions and protons then facilitate a common buffering reaction that yields carbon dioxide and water before their egress back to the cytoplasm via diffusion or water channels. The flattened morphology of the Golgi cisternae helps this process, as their high surface-volume ratio is optimal for water and gas exchange. Interestingly, this net acid efflux pathway is often upregulated in cancers and established cancer cell lines, and responsible for their markedly elevated Golgi resting pH and attenuated glycosylation potential. Accordingly, AE2 knockdown in SW-48 colorectal cancer cells was able to restore these two phenomena, and at the same time, reverse their invasive and anchorage-independent growth phenotype. These findings suggest a possibility to return malignant cells to a benign state by restoring Golgi resting pH."

However, it is unknown whether BPTF regulates the progression of ovarian cancer (OC). To investigate this, we measured the relative expression levels of BPTF in OC cell lines and tissues using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively, and the results were analyzed using the chi(2) test. We also examined the effects from BPTF knockdown on the proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and apoptosis of OC cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that these effects were achieved through simultaneous modulation of multiple signaling pathways. We found that BPTF was highly expressed in OC cell lines and tissues compared with a normal human ovarian epithelial cell line and non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.05). These results are also supported by the public RNA-seq data. BPTF overexpression was correlated with a poor prognosis for OC patient survival (P < 0.05). In vitro experiments revealed that the downregulation of BPTF inhibited OC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasiveness, and induced apoptosis. BPTF knockdown also affected the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways and induced the cleavage of apoptosis-related proteins. Consequently, BPTF plays a critical role in OC cell survival, and functions as a potential therapeutic target for OC."

However, its biological role and exact mechanism in cervical cancer remain unknown. Here, both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot assays demonstrated that the expression of PRDM4 in cervical cancer tissues was much lower than that in the normal cervix. A xenograft assay showed that PRDM4 overexpression in the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and HeLa dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vivo. Conversely, the silencing of PRDM4 promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, PRDM4 induced cell cycle arrest at the transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase by upregulating p27 and p21 expression and downregulating Cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inactivated in PRDM4-overexpressing cells, which decreased the levels of p-AKT and upregulated the expression of PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and qChIP assays confirmed that PRDM4 transactivated the expression of PTEN by binding to two specific regions in the PTEN promoter. Furthermore, PTEN silencing or a PTEN inhibitor rescued the cell defects induced by PRDM4 overexpression. Therefore, our data suggest that PRDM4 inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by downregulating the activity of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by directly transactivating PTEN expression in cervical cancer."

Targeting BCSCs may ameliorate therapy resistance, tumor growth, and metastatic progression. However, the origin and molecular mechanisms underlying their cellular properties are poorly understood. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) promotes mammary stem/progenitor cell (MaSC) expansion and maintenance but also confers stem-like traits to differentiated tumor cells. Here, we describe the rapid generation of experimentally induced BCSCs by TAZ-mediated reprogramming of human mammary epithelial cells, hence allowing for the direct analysis of BCSC phenotypes. Specifically, we establish genetically well-defined TAZ-dependent (TAZ(DEP)) and -independent (TAZ(IND)) cell lines with cancer stem cell (CSC) traits, such as self-renewal, variable resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and tumor seeding potential. TAZ(DEP) cells were associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, embryonic, and MaSC signature genes. In contrast, TAZ(IND) cells were characterized by a neuroendocrine transdifferentiation transcriptional program associated with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Mechanistically, we identify Cyclin D1 (CCND1) as a critical downstream effector for TAZ-driven tumorigenesis. Overall, our results reveal a critical TAZ-CCND1-CDK4/CDK6 signaling axis, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches to eliminate both BCSCs and therapy-resistant cancer cells."

However, in the oral cavity, various mucosal diseases may be encountered, including reactive lesions and oral potentially malignant disorders, and it is difficult to differentiate OSCC from these lesions based on both clinical and histopathological findings. It is well known that chronic inflammation contributes to oral cancer development. Macrophages are among the most common inflammatory cells in cancer stromal tissue and have various roles in cancer aggressiveness. Although the roles of macrophages in cancer development have attracted attention, only a few studies have linked macrophages to carcinogenesis, particularly, oral precancerous lesions. Summary: This review article consists of 3 parts: first, we summarize current knowledge on macrophages in human various epithelial precancerous lesions, excluding the oral cavity, to show the importance and gaps in knowledge regarding macrophages in carcinogenesis; second, we review published data related to the role of macrophages in oral carcinogenesis; finally, we present a novel view on oral carcinogenesis, focusing on crosstalk between epithelial cells and macrophages. Key Messages: The biological features of macrophages in oral carcinogenesis differ drastically depending on the anatomical compartment that they infiltrate. Focusing on the alteration of macrophage infiltrating compartment may serve as a useful novel approach for studying the role of the macrophages in oral carcinogenesis and for gaining further insight into cancer prevention and early detection."

The phagocytosis checkpoint in macrophages has broader implications for current cancer immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we demonstrate the modulation in the antitumor activity of macrophages within the aberrant metabolic microenvironment of TNBC by metabolic intervention. The co-culture of macrophages with TNBC cell lines led to a decrease in both their phagocytic function and expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The transcription of glycolysis and fatty acid (FA) catabolism-related factors was inhibited within the dysregulated tumor metabolic microenvironment. Enhancement of FA catabolism by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonist, fenofibrate (FF), could re-establish macrophages to gain their antineoplastic activity by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway and increasing ATP production by FA oxidation. The combination of fenofibrate and anti-CD47 therapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in a 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. In conclusion, the enhancement of FA catabolism of macrophages could re-establish them to resume antitumor activity in the TME. Anti-CD47 therapy combined with fenofibrate may serve as a novel and potential immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of TNBC."

USP18 removes ISG15 from substrate proteins. This study reports that USP18-null mice (vs. wild-type mice) exhibited lower lipolysis rates, altered fat to body weight ratios, and cold sensitivity. USP18 is a regulator of lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Prior work established that USP18 promotes lung tumorigenesis. We sought to learn whether this occurs through altered lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Loss of USP18 repressed adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) expression; gain of USP18 expression upregulatcd ATGL in lung cancer cells. The E1-like ubiquitin activating enzyme promoted ISG15 conjugation of ATGL and destabilization. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ISG15 covalently conjugates to ATGL. Protein expression of themiogenic regulators was examined in brown fat of USP18-null versus wild-type mice. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was repressed in USP18-null fat. Gain of USP18 expression augmented UCP1 protein via reduced ubiquitination. Gain of UCP1 expression in lung cancer cell lines enhanced cellular proliferation. UCP1 knockdown inhibited proliferation. Beta-hydroxybutyrate colorimetric assays performed after gain of UCP1 expression revealed increased cellular fatty acid beta-oxidation, augmenting fatty acid beta-oxidation in Seahorse assays. Combined USP18, ATGL, and UCP1 profiles were interrogated in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Intriguingly, lung cancers with increased USP18, ATGL, and UCP1 expression had an unfavorable survival. These findings reveal that USP18 is a pharmacologic target that controls fatty acid metabolism."

Tumor growth and disease progression is mainly dependent on the Androgen Receptor (AR), a ligand dependent transcription factor. Standard PCa therapeutic treatments include androgen-deprivation therapy and AR signaling inhibitors. Despite being successful in controlling the disease in the majority of men, the high frequency of disease progression to aggressive and therapy resistant stages (termed castrate resistant prostate cancer) has led to the search for new therapeutic targets. The p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1-4) family is a group of highly conserved Ser/Thr kinases that holds promise as a novel target. RSKs are effector kinases that lay downstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and aberrant activation or expression of RSKs has been reported in several malignancies, including PCa. Despite their structural similarities, RSK isoforms have been shown to perform nonredundant functions and target a wide range of substrates involved in regulation of transcription and translation. In this article we review the roles of the RSKs in proliferation and motility, cell cycle control and therapy resistance in PCa, highlighting the possible interplay between RSKs and AR in mediating disease progression. In addition, we summarize the current advances in RSK inhibitor development and discuss their potential clinical benefits."

Selective ERBB2 and BCL2 Inhibition Is Synergistic for Mitochondrial-Mediated Apoptosis in MDS and AML Cells	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; KINASE INHIBITOR; CANCER-CELLS; ERLOTINIB; RECEPTOR; TRASTUZUMAB; SURVIVAL; THERAPY; MCL-1; PHOSPHORYLATION	"The ERBB2 proto-oncogene is associated with an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. Its role in hematologic malignancies is incompletely defined, in part because ERBB2 is not readily detected on the surface of cancer cells. We demonstrate that truncated ERBB2, which lacks the extracellular domain, is over-expressed on primary CD34(+) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells compared with healthy hematopoietic cells. This overexpression of ERBB2 is associated with aberrant, oncogenic signaling with autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine sites. Like in breast cancers, ERBB2 can exist as truncated isoforms p95(ERBB2) and p110(ERBB2) in MDS and AML. Neutralization of ERBB2 signaling with ERBB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e., lapatinib, afatinib, and neratinib) increases apoptotic cell death and reduces human engraftment of MDS cells in mice at 21 weeks posttransplantation. Inhibition of ERBB2 modulates the expression of multiple pro- and anti- apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, including B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Dual blockade with ERBB2 and BCL2 inhibitors triggers additional reductions of BCL2 phosphorylation and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) expression compared with single drug treatment. Dual therapy was synergistic at all tested doses, with a dose reduction index of up to 29 for lapatinib thorn venetoclax compared with venetoclax alone. Notably, these agents operated together and shifted cancer cells to a pro- apoptotic phenotype, resulting in increased mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activated caspase-3-mediated cell death."

However, available therapeutic options are still unsatisfactory in many types of cancer, and often fail due to the occurrence of resistance mechanisms. With regard to small-molecule compounds targeting the components of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2, these drugs may result ineffective as a consequence of the activation of compensatory pro-survival/proliferative signals, including receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K, as well as other components of the MAPK family such as TPL2/COT. The MAPK ERK5 has been identified as a key signaling molecule in the biology of several types of cancer. In this review, we report pieces of evidence regarding the activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway as a resistance mechanism to RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitors. We also highlight the known and possible mechanisms underlying the cross-talks between the ERK1/2 and the ERK5 pathways, the characterization of which is of great importance to maximize, in the future, the impact of RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 targeting. Finally, we emphasize the need of developing additional therapeutically relevant MEK5-ERK5 inhibitors to be used for combined treatments, thus preventing the onset of resistance to cancer therapies relying on RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitors."

It has been suggested that NF-kappa B-driven resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer cells may be mediated by aberrant androgen receptor (AR) activation and AR splice variant production. Preventing resistance to ADT may therefore be achieved by using NF-kappa B inhibitors. However, low oral bioavailability and high toxicity of NF-kappa B inhibitors is a major challenge for clinical translation. Dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) is an oral NF-kappa B inhibitor in clinical development and has already shown favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodyanamic data in patients with heme malignancies, including decrease of NF-kappa B in circulating leuchemic blasts. Here, we report that activation of NF-kappa B/p65 by castration in mouse and human prostate cancer models resulted in a significant increase in AR variant-7 (AR-V7) expression and modest upregulation of AR. In vivo castration of VCAP-CR tumors resulted in significant upregulation of phosphorylated-p65 and AR-V7, which was attenuated by combination with DMAPT and DMAPT increased the efficacy of AR inhibition. We further demonstrate that the effects of DMAPT-sensitizing prostate cancer cells to castration were dependent on the ability of DM APT to inhibit phosphorylated-p65 function."

In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms involved in the anti-cancer efficacy of BA in U937 human myeloid leukemia cells. BA exerted a significant cytotoxic effect on U937 cells through blocking cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis, and that the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased after treatment with BA. The down-regulation of cyclin A and cyclin B1, and up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 revealed the G2/M phase arrest mechanism of BA. In addition, BA induced the cytosolic release of cytochrome c by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential with an increasing Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio. BA also increased the activity of caspase-9 and -3, and subsequent degradation of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, quenching of ROS by N-acetyl-cysteine, an ROS scavenger, markedly abolished BA-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis, indicating that the generation of ROS plays a key role in inhibiting the proliferation of U937 cells by BA treatment. Taken together, our results provide a mechanistic rationale that BA exhibits anti-cancer properties in U937 leukemia cells through ROS-dependent induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis."

Thus, targeting super-enhancers (SEs), which modulate the transcriptional activity of oncogenes, has become an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. As yet, however, the molecular mechanisms of this process in bladder cancer (BC) remain to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to provide detailed information regarding the SE landscape in BC and to investigate new potential pharmaceutical targets for BC therapy. Methods We employed THZ1 as a potent and specific CDK7 inhibitor. In vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to investigate the anticancer and apoptosis-inducing effects of THZ1 on BC cells. Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were performed to investigate the mechanism and function of SE-linked oncogenic transcription in BC cells. Results We found that THZ1 serves as an effective and potent inhibitor with suppressive activity against BC cells. An integrative analysis of THZ1-sensitive and SE-associated oncogenes yielded potential new pharmaceutical targets, including DDIT4, B4GALT5, PSRC1 and MED22. Combination treatment with THZ1 and the DDIT4 inhibitor rapamycin effectively suppressed BC cell growth. In addition, we found that THZ1 and rapamycin sensitized BC cells to conventional chemotherapy. Conclusions Our data indicate that exploring BC gene regulatory mechanisms associated with SEs through integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data improves our understanding of BC biology and provides a basis for innovative therapies."

Abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) could lead to cancer development. This study was aimed to explore the roles of DEX in ovarian cancer (OC) development. OC cell lines SKOV3 and HO-8910 were treated with DEX, after which OC development and the miR-185, SOX9, and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were measured. DEX-treated HO-8910 cells were transfected with miR-185 mimic, miR-185 antisense or miR-185 antisense + silenced SOX9 to further measure the OC cell growth. The target relation between miR-185 and SOX9 was identified, and SOX9 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were protein levels detected after miR-185 transfection. The role of miR-185 in OC in vivo was also measured. Our study found DEX had a dose-dependent inhibition on OC growth, and DEX promoted miR-185 but suppressed SOX9 expression in OC cells. miR-185 targeted SOX9. After interfering with miR-185 expression, HO-8910 cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were affected. SOX9 knockdown repressed OC development and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The volume, weight, positive rate of Ki67, CyclinD1, p53 and the degree of tumor necrosis were affected by miR-185 expression. This study demonstrated that DEX could inhibit OC development via upregulating miR-185 expression and inactivating the SOX9/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway."

The present study examined the role of collagen type V alpha 1 (COL5A1) and the characteristics of COL5A1 as an oncogenic protein in OC. The association of COL5A1 with paclitaxel (PTX)-resistance and stemness in OC was also studied and the multidatabase and big data analyses of the prognostic value, coexpression network, genetic alterations, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells of COL5A1 were elucidated. We found that COL5A1 expression was high in OC cells and tissues. Knockdown of COL5A1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of OC cells. Further study also showed that COL5A1 was overexpressed in PTX-resistant OC cells compared to respective PTX-sensitive cells. Additionally, COL5A1 was more enriched in OC stem cell-like cells. Silencing COL5A1 expression decreased the OC cell resistance to PTX and inhibited the ability of OC-spheroid formation. Survival analysis predicted that the elevated COL5A1 expression was associated with a worse survival outcome and correlated to the tumor stage of OC patients. The estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm analysis also unveiled the correlation of several tumor-infiltrating immune cells with the expression of COL5A1. Taken together, our data demonstrate that COL5A1 is a biomarker to predict OC progression and PTX-resistance and represents a promising target for OC treatment."

Beyond its well-established involvement in the regulation of transcription, the physiological functions of CARM1 are still poorly understood. However, recent studies have revealed novel roles of CARM1 in autophagy, metabolism, paraspeckles, and early development. In addition, CARM1 is emerging as an attractive therapeutic target and a drug response biomarker for certain types of cancer. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structure of CARM1 and its post-translational modifications, its various functions, apart from transcriptional coactivation, and its involvement in cancer."

We further show that DEAD-box helicase 49 (DDX49) is up-regulated in HCC tumors, and that knocking down the DDX49 gene decreases tumor formation in vivo and in vitro, as well as reduces tumor metastasis in vivo. Morphine decreases DDX49 expression in HCC cells. Our results suggest that DDX49 contributes to HCC, and that morphine may exert anti-cancer effects by down-regulating it."

This is exacerbated by its highly aggressive phenotype, and limitation in early diagnosis and effective therapies. The SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 1 (SAE1) is a component of a heterodimeric small ubiquitin-related modifier that plays a vital role in SUMOylation, a post-translational modification involving in cellular events such as regulation of transcription, cell cycle and apoptosis. Reported overexpression of SAE1 in glioma in a stage-dependent manner suggests it has a probable role in cancer initiation and progression. In this study, hypothesizing that SAE1 is implicated in HCC metastatic phenotype and poor prognosis, we analyzed the expression of SAE1 in several cancer databases and to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism of SAE1-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that SAE1 is over-expressed in HCC samples compared to normal liver tissue, and this observed SAE1 overexpression is stage and grade-dependent and associated with poor survival. The receiver operating characteristic analysis of SAE1 in TCGA-LIHC patients (n = 421) showed an AUC of 0.925, indicating an excellent diagnostic value of SAE1 in HCC. Our protein-protein interaction analysis for SAE1 showed that SAE1 interacted with and activated oncogenes such as PLK1, CCNB1, CDK4 and CDK1, while simultaneously inhibiting tumor suppressors including PDK4, KLF9, FOXO1 and ALDH2. Immunohistochemical staining and clinicopathological correlate analysis of SAE1 in our TMU-SHH HCC cohort (n = 54) further validated the overexpression of SAE1 in cancerous liver tissues compared with 'normal' paracancerous tissue, and high SAE1 expression was strongly correlated with metastasis and disease progression. The oncogenic effect of upregulated SAE1 is associated with dysregulated cancer metabolic signaling. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that SAE1 is a targetable cancer metabolic biomarker with high potential diagnostic and prognostic implications for patients with HCC."

In recent years, many studies have shown that mitochondria play important roles in tumorigenesis and may act as chemotherapeutic targets in PC. In addition, according to recent studies, mitochondria may play important roles in the chemoresistance of PC by affecting apoptosis, metabolism, mtDNA metabolism, and mitochondrial dynamics. Interfering with some of these factors in mitochondria may improve the sensitivity of PC cells to chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, making mitochondria promising targets for overcoming chemoresistance in PC."

These results suggested that Metformin attenuated EOC metastasis through Girdin and targeting Girdin may be a promising therapeutic strategy for EOC in the future."

Therapeutic strategies designed to target the fundamental biology of leukemia stem cells while sparing normal hematopoietic cells may provide better outcomes for leukemia patients. One process in leukemia stem cell biology that has intriguing therapeutic potential is energy metabolism. In this article we discuss the metabolic properties of leukemia stem cells and how targeting energy metabolism may provide more effective therapeutic regimens for leukemia patients.

Upon MYC hyperactivation, SF3A3 levels are modulated translationally through an RNA stem-loop in an elF3D-dependent manner. This ensures accurate splicing of mRNAs enriched for mitochondrial regulators. Altered SF3A3 translation leads to metabolic reprogramming and stem-like properties that fuel MYC tumorigenic potential in vivo. Our analysis reveals that SF3A3 protein levels predict molecular and phenotypic features of aggressive human breast cancers. These findings unveil a post-transcriptional interplay between splicing and translation that governs critical facets of MYC-driven oncogenesis."

However, the remarkable level of crosstalk between sex hormones, the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and its ligands IGF-1 and 2 in endocrine driven cancers is incompletely understood. Similar to the sex steroids, IGF signalling is essential in normal development as well as growth and tissue homoeostasis, and undergoes a steady decline with advancing age and increasing visceral adiposity. Interestingly, IGF-1 has been found to play a compensatory role for both estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) by augmenting hormonal responses in the absence of, or where low levels of ligand are present. Furthermore, experimental, and epidemiological evidence supports a role for dysregulated IGF signalling in breast and prostate cancers. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) molecules can regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1 and are frequently expressed in these hormonally regulated tissues. The link between age-related disease and the role of IGF-1 in the process of ageing and longevity has gained much attention over the last few decades, spurring the development of numerous IGF targeted therapies that have, to date, failed to deliver on their therapeutic potential. This review will provide an overview of the sexually dimorphic nature of IGF signalling in humans and how this is impacted by the reduction in sex steroids in mid-life. It will also explore the latest links with metabolic syndromes, hormonal imbalances associated with ageing and targeting of IGF signalling in endocrine-related tumour growth with an emphasis on post-menopausal breast cancer and the impact of the steroidal milieu."

Forward genetic screens have also been performed using CRISPR/Cas9 systems to identify new driver genes and approaches using catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to base editors have enabled genome editing with single-base precision.

Due to uncontrolled growth, GBC cells rapidly synthesize biomolecules including lipids. The lipids are integral component of cell membrane with a wide range of cellular functions. In this study, we measured the clinicopathological features in 40 cases of histologically confirmed GBC and 16 cases of chronic cholecystitis (CC). The female to male ratio in the GBC and CC groups were 3.44:1 and 2.2:1, respectively. The GBC patients exhibited well to poorly differentiated tumor. In the CC group, all patients showed cholecystitis with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. The majority of GBC and CC patients reported pain. Using H-1 NMR spectroscopy, we observed 4-folds increase in the level of choline containing phospholipids (CCPLs) in the gallbladder of GBC patients as compared to CC patients. Other lipid metabolites such as cholesterol ester, C18-cholesterol and saturated fatty acids were insignificantly changed between GBC and CC patients. Moreover, the level of CCPLs in the GBC patients with BMI <25 kg/m(2) was significantly higher as compared to CC patients. Further, a significant increase in the CCPLs level was observed in GBC female patients in comparison to CC patients. From the computational analyses, we observed that the genes involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) indirectly interact with the RELA, which encodes the NF-kappa B p65 subunit. The genes involved in the PtdCho biosynthesis were also correlated with the overall and disease-free survival of cholangiocarcinoma patients. The study opens new window for exploring the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of CCPLs in GBC patients."

We found that autophagy abrogation virtually abolishes mammary tumorigenesis in the ERBB2-driven model, exhibiting stronger inhibitory effects than in our previous studies using PyMT and brca1-null mouse models.

This study explored the role of miR-224 in CAF-induced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods: A CAF-NSCLC cell co-culture model was established, and the miR-224 expression in CAF was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gain- and loss- of experiments of miR-224 were implemented to verify the effects of CAF on NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and endothelial cell (EC) angiogenesis. Overexpressing genetic or pharmacological interventions were performed to explore the potential mechanisms of Sirtuins 3/AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (SIRT3/AMPK/mTOR/HIF-1 alpha). Results: CAF enhanced the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells and induced EC angiogenesis. miR-224 was significantly altered in CAFs. miR-224 up-regulation exacerbated NSCLC development mediated by CAFs, while miR-224 inhibition mostly reversed CAF-induced effects. Mechanistically, miR-224 targeted the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of SIRT3 mRNA, thereby inhibiting SIRT3/AMPK and activating mTOR/HIF-1 alpha. Forced overexpression of SIRT3 up-regulated AMPK and inactivated mTOR/HIF-1 alpha, while inhibiting HIF-1 alpha markedly up-regulated SIRT3/AMPK and reduced mTOR phosphorylation. Interestingly, both Sirt1 overexpression and HIF-1 alpha inhibition repressed miR-224 levels and miR-224-mediated promotive effects in NSCLC.

Methods and Materials We obtained high prediction accuracy and determined the correlation between the expression of WASL and the clinical characteristics of cervical cancer patients. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using microarray. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to determine potentially relevant mechanisms related to the prognostication ability of WASL expression. Results Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that lower expression of WASL was associated with lower pathological stage (chi-square test: p = 0.022, chi-square = 9.613; logistic regression: OR = 0.869, 95% CI: 0.756-0.991, p = 0.041). Patients in the WASL high expression group have worse overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR): 0.555, 95% CI: 0.348-0.884, log-rank p = 0.012] and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 0.449, 95% CI: 0.215-0.934, log-rank p = 0.028) compared with those in the WASL low expression group. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model suggested that WASL expression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS and RFS in cervical cancer. DEGs were mostly enriched GO terms related to DNA replication or the proliferation of tumor cells. The results of GSEA suggested samples in the WASL knockdown group were enriched in glycolysis, TNF-alpha signaling via NFkB, mTORC1 signaling, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Conclusions WASL expression was associated with the pathological stage, and it might be an independent prognostication factor in patients with cervical cancer. Knockdown of WASL might be correlated with biological processes such as glycolysis, TNF alpha signaling, mTOR signaling, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling."

Therapies targeting molecular pathways altered in BC had significantly enhanced treatment options for BC over the last decades, which ultimately improved the lives of millions of women worldwide. Among various molecular pathways accruing substantial interest for the development of targeted therapies are cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)-in particular, the two closely related members CDK4 and CDK6. CDK4/6 inhibitors indirectly trigger the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein by blocking CDK4/6, thereby blocking the cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase. Although the CDK4/6 inhibitors abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib gained FDA approval for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC as they significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in randomized clinical trials, regrettably, some patients showed resistance to these therapies. Though multiple molecular pathways could be mechanistically responsible for CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy resistance, one of the most predominant ones seems to be the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway. FGFRs are involved in many aspects of cancer formation, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth. Importantly, FGFRs are frequently mutated in BC, and their overexpression and/or hyperactivation correlates with CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance and shortened PFS in BC. Intriguingly, the inhibition of aberrant FGFR activity is capable of reversing the resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. This review summarizes the molecular background of FGFR signaling and discusses the role of aberrant FGFR signaling during cancer development in general and during the development of CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance in BC in particular, together with other possible mechanisms for resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Subsequently, future directions on novel therapeutic strategies targeting FGFR signaling to overcome such resistance during BC treatment will be further debated."

DNA mismatch repair-deficient non-neoplastic endometrial glands are common in Lynch syndrome patients and are present at a higher density than in the colon	HISTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						colon; DNA mismatch repair; endometrium; immunohistochemistry; lynch syndrome	COLORECTAL-CANCER; MANAGEMENT; SOCIETY	"Aims The hallmark of Lynch syndrome (LS) is DNA mismatch repair protein (MMR) deficiency. Recently, MMR deficiency in non-neoplastic colonic crypts has been identified as a novel indicator of LS. We aimed to determine whether MMR-deficient non-neoplastic endometrial glands can distinguish patients with and without LS, and to compare the level of MMR deficiency in the normal endometrium and colon in LS patients. Methods and results We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of MMR proteins in the normal endometrial mucosa from 64 patients, including 34 patients with confirmed LS (17 with endometrial cancer and 17 without cancer), 30 patients with endometrial cancer without LS (10 with tumours with MLH1 promoter hypermethylation and 20 with MMR-proficient tumours), and in the normal colonic mucosa from 30 LS patients. MMR-deficient non-neoplastic endometrial glands were identified in 47% of LS patients and in no patients without LS (P < 0.001). MMR-deficient non-neoplastic glands were more often identified in LS patients with endometrial cancer (65%) than in those without endometrial cancer (29%) (P = 0.04). In contrast to what was seen in the normal colon, MMR-deficient glands in the normal endometrium were seen as large, contiguous groups, ranging in number from two to 101 (87% versus 45%, P = 0.02). MMR-deficient glands were identified at a higher density in the endometrium than in the colon in LS patients (median number of MMR-deficient glands, 22 versus two, P = 0.02). Conclusions Our findings indicate that MMR-deficient non-neoplastic endometrial glands constitute an indicator of LS, and that MMR-deficient glands in the endometrium are present in a pattern of contiguous large groups."

However, acquiring and managing the sample quality, which greatly influences the analyses, are not sufficient and hence requires immediate attention. We introduced time stamp (TS) recording and documentation using the Standard PREanalytical Code (SPREC) for breast cancer surgery samples to monitor and control their quality. Materials and Methods: The TS recording used SPREC for quality control of each sample by recording seven factors: type of sample, type of collection, warm ischemia time (WIT), cold ischemia time (CIT), fixation type, fixation time (FT), and long-term storage. The responsibilities to record each factor were assigned among group members (breast surgeons, anesthesiologists, pathologists, operating room nurses, and medical technologists in pathology). Results: Records based on SPREC were recorded for 393 surgical cases of first-time breast cancer patients performed at the Kanagawa Cancer Center from May 2018 to April 2019. The vascular clamp time was defined as when skin flap formation was completed, regardless of the surgical procedure. An anesthesiologist recorded the vascular clamp time and sample collection time, and the pathologist recorded the fixation start time and fixation end time. WIT was 23 (3-116) minutes (breast-conserving surgery, 11 [3-38] minutes; mastectomy, 26 [5-116] minutes; and nipple-sparing mastectomy, 39 [31-43] minutes), CIT was 37 (3-1052) minutes, and FT was 43 (17-115) hours. The median CIT and FT were significantly shortened after introducing the TS system, and the variabilities were reduced. Conclusion: A TS system for quality control of breast cancer surgical sample functions well due to the establishment of highly versatile WIT and a working group consisting of multiple members of different occupations who shared roles."

Moreover, the delicate developmental processes of the nervous system throughout the childhood years adds another limitation to the therapeutic modalities and doses used to treat these malignant cancers. Therefore, pediatric oncologists are charged with the daunting responsibility of attempting to deliver effective cures to these children, yet with limited doses of the currently available therapeutic options in order to mitigate the imminent neurotoxicity of radio- and chemotherapy on the developing nervous system. Various studies reported that c-Met/HGF signaling is affiliated with increased malignancy and stem cell enrichment in various cancers such as high-grade gliomas, high-risk medulloblastomas, and MYCN-amplified, high-risk neuroblastomas. Therapeutic interventions that are utilized to target c-Met signaling in these malignant nervous system cancers have shown benefits in basic translational studies and preclinical trials, but failed to yield significant clinical benefits in patients. While numerous pre-clinical data reported promising results with the use of combinatorial therapy that targets c-Met with other tumorigenic pathways, therapeutic resistance remains a problem, and long-term cures are rare. The possible mechanisms, including the overexpression and activation of compensatory tumorigenic mechanisms within the tumors or ineffective drug delivery methods that may contribute to therapeutic resistance observed in clinical trials are elaborated in this review."

Its clinical utility as an oral anticancer agent, however, is limited by poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal toxicity. Fosciclopirox, the phosphoryloxymethyl ester of CPX (Ciclopirox Prodrug, CPX-POM), selectively delivers the active metabolite, CPX, to the entire urinary tract following parenteral administration. We characterized the activity of CPX-POM and its major metabolites in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of high-grade urothelial cancer. CPX inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroid formation, and increased cell cycle arrest at S and G0/G1 phases. Mechanistically, CPX suppressed activation of Notch signaling. Molecular modeling and cellular thermal shift assays demonstrated CPX binding to gamma -secretase complex proteins Presenilin 1 and Nicastrin, which are essential for Notch activation. To establish in vivo preclinical proof of principle, we tested fosciclopirox in the validated N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) mouse bladder cancer model. Once-daily intraperitoneal administration of CPX-POM for four weeks at doses of 235mg/kg and 470mg/kg significantly decreased bladder weight, a surrogate for tumor volume, and resulted in a migration to lower stage tumors in CPX-POM treated animals. This was coupled with a reduction in the proliferation index. Additionally, there was a reduction in Presenilin 1 and Hes-1 expression in the bladder tissues of CPX-POM treated animals. Following the completion of the first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT03348514), the pharmacologic activity of fosciclopirox is currently being characterized in a Phase 1 expansion cohort study of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients scheduled for cystectomy (NCT04608045) as well as a Phase 2 trial of newly diagnosed and recurrent urothelial cancer patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (NCT04525131)."

It is overexpressed in many solid tumors and plays an important role in the prognosis and biological behaviors of tumors such as occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis. However, exploration of the role and molecular mechanism of CBX8 in tumors is still in its infancy. Our study found that the down-regulation of CBX8 expression by RNA interference induced differential expression of several microRNAs in human colon cancer cells. The 5 most differentially expressed miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) (hsa-miR-363-3p, hsa-miR-378a-3p, hsa-miR-371b-3p, hsa-miR-361-3p, and hsa-miR-576-3p) share a common motif sequence: ARAAAKUGCMC. We selected miR-378a-3p and further revealed that the negative regulation of miRNA expression by CBX8 mainly occurs in the processing of pre-miRNA to mature miRNA. CBX8 uses its own RNA-binding domain to interact with pre-miRNA, and is dependent on its own nuclear localization characteristics to limit nucleoplasmic transport of pre-miRNA. Changing the characteristic sequence of pre-miRNA or mutating the RNA-binding domain and nuclear localization signal of CBX8 can effectively weaken the regulation of miR-378a-3p expression by CBX8. However, our experimental results showed that miR-378a-3p inhibited the malignant expression of human colon cancer cells by targeting PDIA4, resulting in increased activity of caspases-3 and -7. In summary, our study suggests that CBX8 acts as an independent RNA-binding protein to regulate miRNA expression. Simultaneously, this study shows the correlation between the CBX8/miR-378a-3p/PDIA4 pathway and the malignant biological properties of colorectal cancer, suggesting this proposed pathway as a possible therapeutic target for human cancers."

We have shown that a unique E. coli MazF-MazE toxin-antitoxin (TA) system can be used for selective and effective eradication of RAS-mutated cancer cells. This out of the box strategy holds great promise for effective cancer treatment and management. We provide proof of concept for a novel platform to selectively eradicate cancer cells using an adenoviral delivery system based on the adjusted natural bacterial system. We generated adenoviral vectors carrying the mazF toxin (pAdEasy-Py4-SV40mP-mCherry-MazF) and the antitoxin mazE (pAdEasy-RGC-SV40mP-MazE-IRES-GFP) under the regulation of RAS and p53, resp. The control vector carries the toxin without the RAS-responsive element (pAdEasy-Delta Py4-SV40mP-mCherry-MazF). In vitro, the mazF-mazE TA system (Py4-SV40mP-mCherry-MazF+RGC-SV40mP-MazE-IRES-GFP) induced massive, dose-dependent cell death, at 69% compared to 19% for the control vector, in a co-infected HCT116 cell line. In vivo, the system caused significant tumor growth inhibition of HCT116 (KRAS(mut)/p53(mut)) tumors at 73 and 65% compared to PBS and Delta PY4 control groups, resp. In addition, we demonstrate 65% tumor growth inhibition in HCT116 (KRAS(mut)/p53(wt)) cells, compared to the other two control groups, indicating a contribution of the antitoxin in blocking system leakage in WT RAS cells. These data provide evidence of the feasibility of using mutations in the p53 and RAS pathway to efficiently kill cancer cells. The platform, through its combination of the antitoxin (mazE) with the toxin (mazF), provides effective protection of normal cells from basal low activity or leakage of mazF."

Bcl-2 proteins also act at the endoplasmic reticulum, the main intracellular Ca2+-storage organelle, where they inhibit IP3 receptors (IP3R) and prevent pro-apoptotic Ca2+-signaling events. IP3R channels are targeted by the BH4 domain of Bcl-2. Some cancer types rely on the IP3R-Bcl-2 interaction for survival. We previously developed a cell-permeable, BH4-domain-targeting peptide that can abrogate Bcl-2?s inhibitory action on IP3Rs, named Bcl-2 IP3 receptor disrupter-2 (BIRD-2). This peptide kills several Bcl-2-dependent cancer cell types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, by eliciting intracellular Ca2+ signalling. However, the exact mechanisms by which these excessive Ca2+ signals triggered by BIRD-2 provoke cancer cell death remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate in DLBCL that although BIRD-2 activates caspase 3/7 and provokes cell death in a caspase-dependent manner, the cell death is independent of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members, Bim, Bax and Bak. Instead, BIRD-2 provokes mitochondrial Ca2+ overload that is rapidly followed by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Inhibiting mitochondrial Ca2+ overload using Ru265, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex counteracts BIRD-2-induced cancer cell death. Finally, we validated our findings in primary CLL patient samples where BIRD-2 provoked mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and Ru265 counteracted BIRD-2-induced cell death. Overall, this work reveals the mechanisms by which BIRD-2 provokes cell death, which occurs via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload but acts independently of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members."

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the predominant type of OC. Investigating the mechanism underlying tumorigenesis and progression of EOC is urgent. Our previous research has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) CDKN2A-AS1 is upregulated in EOC tissues and cells. Furthermore, we have predicted that CDKN2A-AS1 is associated with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD signaling pathway, which is negatively regulated by the sclerostin domain containing 1 (SOSTDC1). Therefore, we conjecture that the CDKN2A-AS1 regulate BMP-SMAD signaling pathway via interacting with SOSTDC1, which need more investigation. Moreover, the functions of the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway and the SOSTDC1 on EOC are still unclear. Herein, we unearthed that CDKN2A-AS1, BMP2/4/7, SMAD1/5/9 and phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/9 (p-SMAD1/5/9) were upregulated in EOC tissues and cells, whereas SOSTDC1 was downregulated in EOC tissues and cells. We firstly demonstrated that CDKN2A-AS1 bound directly with the SOSTDC1. CDKN2A-AS1 downregulated the expression of SOSTDC1, but upregulated the expression of BMP2/4/7, SMAD1/5/9, and p-SMAD1/5/9. CDKN2A-AS1 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion of EOC cells and tumor growth in vivo, whereas SOSTDC1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion of EOC cells. Knockdown SOSTDC1 rescued the inhibitory effect of si-lncRNA CDKN2A-AS1 on the EOC cells proliferation, migration and invasion. These results demonstrated that CDKN2A-AS1activated the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway by directly bind with SOSTDC1 to promote EOC tumor growth. CDKN2A-AS1/SOSTDC1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for EOC treatment."

Here, we determine the value of tumour budding and CD8(+) in rectal cancer patients treated with/without neoadjuvant therapy. Methods and results Using digital scans of all tumour slides/case, we analysed CD8(+) T cell counts in two patient cohorts: 45 neoadjuvantly treated and 47 primarily surgically treated (totalling n = 543 slides) after double-staining of the surgical resection specimen for pan-cytokeratin and CD8(+). Tumour buds in hot-spots were manually counted (area = 0.785 mm(2)) and CD8(+) T cell counts were analysed separately both in tumour budding hot-spots and the densest CD8(+) regions throughout the tumour. In neoadjuvantly treated patients, only tumour budding and not CD8(+) T cells was associated with tumour features, including more advanced ypT (P = 0.0062), venous invasion (P = 0.002), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.0003) and perineural invasion (P = 0.0017), as well as higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumour regression score (P = 0.0035), indicating less tumour response. Overall survival was also worse in patients with high-grade budding in univariate analysis only. In contrast, all three variables, namely tumour budding (P = 0.0347), CD8(+) T cells in budding hot-spots (P = 0.0382) and CD8(+) T cells in the densest areas (P = 0.0117) were also associated with worse (budding) and better (CD8) survival time in the multivariate setting. Conclusion In rectal cancer, tumour budding has clinical relevance in both primarily surgically treated patients and in those with neoadjuvantly treated patients, where it characterises highly aggressive residual disease.

Recent studies have revealed that liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) plays a vital role in the metastasis of several human cancers, but its role is unknown in the metastasis of OS. In this study, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses based on high-throughput RNA-seq data revealed that LRH-1 acted a pivotal part in the positive regulation of cell migration, motility, and angiogenesis. Consistently, LRH-1 knockdown inhibited the migration of human OS cells, which was concurrent with the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the upregulation of epithelial markers. In addition, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting LRH-1 inactivated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway. LRH-1 knockdown inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression was also downregulated after LRH-1 knockdown. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that the expression of LRH-1 protein was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal bone tissues. We found that high LRH-1 expression was associated with poor differentiation and advanced TNM stage in OS patients using IHC. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, high LRH-1 expression predicts poor survival in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). The downregulation of LRH-1 significantly hindered the migration and motility of LUSC cells. Using multi-omic bioinformatics, the positive correlation between LRH-1- and EMT-related genes was found across these three cancer types. GO analysis indicated that LRH-1 played a vital role in blood vessel morphogenesis or vasculogenesis in KIRP. Our results indicated that LRH-1 plays a tumor-promoting role in human OS, could predict the early metastatic potential, and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy."

Cytokines secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within various tumors influences these features, but the function in particular of TGF beta 1 (transforming growth factor beta 1) is controversial and unknown in SCLC. This study explored the influence of TGF beta 1 in CAFs on the development, immune microenvironment, and radiotherapy sensitivity of SCLC. Methods: SCLC specimens were collected from 90 patients who had received no treatment before surgery. Tumor and tumor stroma were subjected to multiplex immunohistochemistry to quantitate TGF beta 1 and other immune factors in CAFs. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry apoptosis assays were used to investigate associations between TGF beta 1 and proliferation and radiotherapy sensitivity. The immune factors in tumors were detected by immunohistochemistry in vitro and in vivo (mice). Results: TGF beta 1 levels on CAFs lower or higher than the median were found, respectively, in 52.2 and 47.8% of patients; overall survival of patients with TGF beta 1-high levels (53.9 mo) was significantly longer than that of the TGF beta 1-low group (26.9 mo; P = 0.037). The univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that a TGF beta 1-high level was an independent predictor of increased survival time. TGF beta 1-high levels in CAFs were associated with inhibition of growth, proliferation, antitumor immunity, and enhanced radiotherapeutic sensitivity and tumor immunity of tumor. TGF beta 1-low levels promoted tumor cell growth and radiotherapy sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion: High levels of TGF beta 1 in CAFs were associated with longer overall survival in patients with SCLC and enhanced radiotherapy sensitivity."

Since the underlying mechanisms of CAGE-promoted anticancer drug resistance are poorly understood, we established Anticancer drug-resistant gastric cancer cells (AGS(R)) to better elucidate possible mechanisms. AGS(R) showed an increased expression level of CAGE and autophagic flux compared with anticancer drug-sensitive parental gastric cancer cells (AGS cells). AGS(R) cells showed higher invasion potential, growth rate, tumor spheroid formation, and angiogenic potential than AGS cells. CAGE exerted effects on the response to anticancer drugs and autophagic flux. CAGE was shown to bind to Beclin1, a mediator of autophagy. Overexpression of CAGE increased autophagic flux and invasion potential but inhibited the cleavage of PARP in response to anticancer drugs in CAGE CRISPR-Cas9 cell lines. TargetScan analysis was utilized to predict the binding of miR-302b-5p to the promoter sequences of CAGE, and the results show that miR-302b-5p directly regulated CAGE expression as illustrated by luciferase activity. MiR-302b-5p regulated autophagic flux and the response to anticancer drugs. CAGE was shown to bind the promoter sequences of miR-302b-5p. The culture medium of AGS(R) cells increased CAGE expression and autophagic flux in AGS cells. ImmunoEM showed CAGE was present in the exosomes of AGS(R) cells; exosomes of AGS(R) cells and human recombinant CAGE protein increased CAGE expression, autophagic flux, and resistance to anticancer drugs in AGS cells. MicroRNA array revealed miR-181b-5p as a potential negative regulator of CAGE. MiR-181b-5p inhibitor increased the expression of CAGE and autophagic flux in addition to preventing anticancer drugs from cleaving poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in AGS cells. TargetScan analysis predicted sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (SIPR1) as a potential target for miR-181b-5p. CAGE showed binding to the promoter sequences of S1PR1. The downregulation or inhibition of S1PR1 led to decreased autophagic flux but enhanced the sensitivity to anticancer drugs in AGS(R) cells.

Later, a group of diverse genes collectively called Polycomb group (PcG) genes were identified based on common mutant phenotypes. PcG proteins, which are well-conserved in animals, were originally characterized as negative regulators of gene transcription during development and subsequently shown to function in various biological processes; their deregulation is associated with diverse phenotypes in development and in disease, especially cancer. PcG proteins function on chromatin and can form two distinct complexes with different enzymatic activities: Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is a histone ubiquitin ligase and PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase. Recent studies have revealed the existence of various mutually exclusive PRC1 and PRC2 variants. In this Review, we discuss new concepts concerning the biochemical and molecular functions of these new PcG complex variants, and how their epigenetic activities are involved in mammalian development and cancer. The histone modifiers Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 have important roles in development and disease, especially cancer.

These conditions are collectively termed Asherman syndrome (AS) and are typically associated with recurrent induced pregnancy terminations, repeated diagnostic curettage and intrauterine infections. Cancer treatment also has unexpected detrimental side effects on endometrial function in survivors independently of ovarian effects. Endometrial stem cells act in the regeneration of the endometrium and in repair through direct differentiation or paracrine effects. Nonendometrial adult stem cells, such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells, with autologous and allogenic applications, can also repair injured endometrial tissue in animal models of AS and in human studies. However, there remains a lack of research on the repair of the damaged endometrium after the reversal of tumors, especially endometrial cancers. Here, we review the biological mechanisms of endometrial regeneration, and research progress and challenges for adult stem cell therapy for damaged endometrium, and discuss the potential applications of their use for endometrial repair after cancer remission, especially in endometrial cancers. Successful application of such cells will improve reproductive parameters in patients with AS or cancer. Significance: The endometrium is the fertile ground for embryos, but damage to the endometrium will greatly impair female fertility. Adult stem cells combined with tissue engineering scaffold materials or not have made great progress in repairing the injured endometrium due to benign lesions. However, due to the lack of research on the repair of the damaged endometrium caused by malignant tumors or tumor therapies, the safety and effectiveness of such stem cell-based therapies need to be further explored. This review focuses on the molecular insights and clinical application potential of adult stem cells in endometrial regeneration and discusses the possible challenges or difficulties that need to be overcome in stem cell-based therapies for tumor survivors. The development of adult stem cell-related new programs will help repair damaged endometrium safely and effectively and meet fertility needs in tumor survivors."

The actin-bundling protein L-plastin has been proposed as a metastatic marker and phosphorylation on its residue Ser5 is known to increase its actin-bundling activity. We recently showed that activation of the ERK/MAPK signalling pathway leads to L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation and that the downstream kinases RSK1 and RSK2 are able to directly phosphorylate Ser5. Here we investigate the involvement of the PI3K pathway in L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation and the functional effect of this phosphorylation event in breast cancer cells. Methods: To unravel the signal transduction network upstream of L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation, we performed computational modelling based on immunoblot analysis data, followed by experimental validation through inhibition/overexpression studies and in vitro kinase assays. To assess the functional impact of L-plastin expression/Ser5 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells, we either silenced L-plastin in cell lines initially expressing endogenous L-plastin or neoexpressed L-plastin wild type and phosphovariants in cell lines devoid of endogenous L-plastin. The established cell lines were used for cell biology experiments and confocal microscopy analysis. Results: Our modelling approach revealed that, in addition to the ERK/MAPK pathway and depending on the cellular context, the PI3K pathway contributes to L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation through its downstream kinase SGK3. The results of the transwell invasion/migration assays showed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of L-plastin in BT-20 or HCC38 cells significantly reduced cell invasion, whereas stable expression of the phosphomimetic L-plastin Ser5Glu variant led to increased migration and invasion of BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, confocal image analysis combined with zymography experiments and gelatin degradation assays provided evidence that L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation promotes L-plastin recruitment to invadopodia, MMP-9 activity and concomitant extracellular matrix degradation. Conclusion: Altogether, our results demonstrate that L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation increases breast cancer cell invasiveness. Being a downstream molecule of both ERK/MAPK and PI3K/SGK pathways, L-plastin is proposed here as a potential target for therapeutic approaches that are aimed at blocking dysregulated signalling outcome of both pathways and, thus, at impairing cancer cell invasion and metastasis formation."

In this decade, the function of Fam20C has been largely disclosed in the loss-of function models. How the influence of the overexpressed Fam20C on cells or organs, and whether Fam20C was associated with tumorogensis still remain unknown. In the latest article in Bioscience Reports, a group from The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University established a correlation between the elevated Fam20C expression and the poor prognosis of multiple cancers (Biosci. Rep. (2021), 41(1) BSR20201920). In addition, they also proposed the potential mechanisms how the increased Fam20C expression played a detrimental role in tumor progression by suggesting that the up-regulated Fam20C level affected the infiltration of immune cells and the capability of cancer metastasis. To give an overview of the expanding knowledge of Fam20C involved in the physiological and pathological events, we first reviewed the history of Fam20C study in this commentary, then, evaluated the correlation of the elevated Fam20C expression to the prognosis of multiple cancers, and finally, interpreted the perspectives that the Fam20C gain-of-function model was also critical for cancer therapy."

Dissecting FGF Signalling to Target Cellular Crosstalk in Pancreatic Cancer	CELLS			English	Review						pancreatic cancer; FGF signalling; crosstalk; stroma; targeted therapy		"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of less than 8%, and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Alongside late detection, which impacts upon surgical treatment, PDAC tumours are challenging to treat due to their desmoplastic stroma and hypovascular nature, which limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), which form a key part of this stroma, become activated in response to tumour development, entering into cross-talk with cancer cells to induce tumour cell proliferation and invasion, leading to metastatic spread. We and others have shown that Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) signalling can play a critical role in the interactions between PDAC cells and the tumour microenvironment, but it is clear that the FGFR signalling pathway is not acting in isolation. Here we describe our current understanding of the mechanisms by which FGFR signalling contributes to PDAC progression, focusing on its interaction with other pathways in signalling networks and discussing the therapeutic approaches that are being developed to try and improve prognosis for this terrible disease."

Cancer progression depends on a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Therefore, illustrating the mechanisms of tumor immunity in underlying HCC metastasis is essential. Here, we report a novel role of solute carrier family 7 member 2 (SLC7A2), a member of the solute carrier family, in HCC metastasis. The reduction of SLC7A2 was an independent and significant risk factor for the survival of HCC patients. Upregulation of SLC7A2 decreased HCC invasion and metastasis, whereas downregulation of SLC7A2 promoted HCC invasion and metastasis. We further found that deficient SLC7A2 medicated the upregulation of CXCL1 through PI3K/Akt/NF-k kappa B pathway to recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), exerting tumor immunosuppressive effect. Moreover, we found that G9a-mediated di-methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me2) silenced the expression of SLC7A2 to suppress HCC metastasis and immune escape. In conclusion, G9a-mediated silencing of SLC7A2 exerts unexpected functions in cancer metastasis by fostering a tumor-supportive microenvironment through CXCL1 secretion and MDSCs recruitment. Thus, SLC7A2 may provide new mechanistic insight into the cancer-promoting property of MDSCs."

However, whether and how alternative splicing regulates autophagy remains largely elusive. Here we systematically identify the splicing factor SRSF1 as an autophagy suppressor. Specifically, SRSF1 inhibits autophagosome formation by reducing the accumulation of LC3-II and numbers of autophagosomes in different cell lines. Mechanistically, SRSF1 promotes the splicing of the long isoform of Bcl-x that interacts with Beclin1, thereby dissociating the Beclin1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, SRSF1 also directly interacts with PIK3C3 to disrupt the interaction between Beclin1 and PIK3C3. Consequently, the decrease of SRSF1 stabilizes the Beclin1 and PIK3C3 complex and activates autophagy. Interestingly, SRSF1 can be degraded by starvation- and oxidative stresses-induced autophagy through interacting with LC3-II, whereas reduced SRSF1 further promotes autophagy. This positive feedback is critical to inhibiting Gefitinib-resistant cancer cell progression both in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the expression level of SRSF1 is inversely correlated to LC3 level in clinical cancer samples. Our study not only provides mechanistic insights of alternative splicing in autophagy regulation but also discovers a new regulatory role of SRSF1 in tumorigenesis, thereby offering a novel avenue for potential cancer therapeutics."

However, DNA methylome in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is still a mystery due to the lack of proper analytical techniques. We introduced an efficient workflow, LCM-mu WGBS, which can efficiently profile the DNA methylation of microdissected CTC samples. LCM-mu WGBS combines the laser capture microdissection (LCM)-based CTC capture method and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in very small CTC population (mu WGBS) to gain insight into the DNA methylation landscape of CTCs. We herein profiled the DNA methylome of CTCs from lung cancer patients. Deriving from a comprehensive analysis of CTC methylome, a unique CTC DNA methylation signature that is distinct from primary lung cancer tissues was identified. Further analysis showed that promoter hypermethylation of epithelial genes is a hallmark of stable epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Moreover, it has been suggested that CTCs are endowed with a stemness-related feature during dissemination and metastasis. This work constitutes a unique DNA methylation analysis of CTCs at single base-pair resolution, which might facilitate to propose noninvasive CTC DNA methylation biomarkers contributing to clinical diagnosis."

In this study, we investigated the role of coiled-coil domain-containing 68 (CCDC68) in IL-6-associated endometrial carcinoma progression. CCDC68 expression levels and the activation of IL-6 pathway were detected by qPCR and Western blot. Stable CCDC68 knockdown Ishikawa and RL-95 cells were created to investigate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion with or without IL-6 administration. Kaplan-Meier's analysis was used to determine the correlation between CCDC68 expression and overall survival or recurrence-free survival in endometrial carcinoma patients. CCDC68 expression level is significantly uregulated by IL-6 stimulation. Increased CCDC68 expression predicts poor prognosis in endometrial carcinoma patients. CCDC68 knockdown dramatically inhibit IL-6-associated cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and downregulate the expression of proto-oncogenes in endometrial carcinoma cells. CCDC68 acts as a cancer-promoting factor in IL-6-stimulated endometrial carcinoma cells, and blocking the expression of CCDC68 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the endometrial carcinoma treatment."

The tumor microenvironment (TME) of PCa is involved in the emergence of immunosuppressive factors such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which regulate the immune system by several mechanisms, including interleukin (IL)-10 production. On the other hand, IL-17(+) helper T cells (Th17) induce MDSCs and chronic inflammation in TME by producing IL-17. This study demonstrated that the frequency of CD33(+) pSTAT3(+) MDSC and IL-17(+) lymphocyte as well as IL-10 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were significantly higher in the PCa patients than in the benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) group. Moreover, there was no significant relationship between the frequency of CD33(+) pSTAT3(+) MDSC, and IL-17(+) lymphocyte with Gleason scores in the PCa group. We suggested that the higher frequency of CD33(+) pSTAT3(+) MDSC and IL-17(+) lymphocyte and the more frequent expression of IL-10 mRNA in PCa patients may play roles in tumor progression from BPH to PCa."

The aim of this study was to determine the association between the diversity of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with PC and other benign pancreatic diseases. In order to make a comprehensive analysis the TCR repertoire, high-throughput sequencing was used to differentiate complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR beta chain in peripheral blood samples from 3 PC, 3 chronic pancreatitis, 3 pancreatic cystic lesions and 3 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour patients. We found that there were significant differences related to TCR repertoire between PC and other pancreatic diseases, and PC is a relatively immunosuppressive tumour. Changes of peripheral TCR repertoire may be used to predict the progression of PC and the response to immunotherapy. And there may exist novel-specific antigens in PC patients which could be used to design targeting immunotherapy in the nearly future."

Recent data suggests that fine balance between anti-angiogenic microRNA (miRNA) and pro-angiogenicmiRNA drive the process of neovascularization. Many of these miRNAs act via G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which regulates diverse physiological processes including angiogenesis. Aberrant GPCR expression and signaling through G-protein often results into uncontrolled angiogenesis, tumor development and metastasis. In this review, we discuss the new emerging insights of GPCR-miRNA network and their interaction in angiogenic pathways leading to the cancer progression. Alongside we have focused on the GPCR mediated angiogenic processes which are controlled by anti-angiogenicmiRNAs and the influence of deregulation of these miRNAs on cancer angiogenesis. Through an extensive literature survey, we identified 7 distinct miRNAs, which are playing important role in regulating angiogenesis. Through network analysis with predicted targets for reported miRNAs and pathway enrichment, 25 major cell signaling pathways associated with tumor-angiogenesis could be identified, further reinforcing the relevance of the miRNAs in the process."

Restricting the localization of centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A to centromeres prevents CIN. CENP-A overexpression (OE) and mislocalization have been observed in cancers and correlate with poor prognosis; however, the molecular consequences of CENP-A OE on CIN and aneuploidy have not been defined. Here, we show that CENP-A OE leads to its mislocalization and CIN with lagging chromosomes and micronuclei in pseudodiploid DLD1 cells and xenograft mouse model. CIN is due to reduced localization of proteins to the kinetochore, resulting in defects in kinetochore integrity and unstable kinetochore-microtubule attachments. CENP-A OE contributes to reduced expression of cell adhesion genes and higher invasion of DLD1 cells. We show that CENP-A OE contributes to aneuploidy with karyotypic heterogeneity in human cells and xenograft mouse model. In summary, our results provide a molecular link between CENP-A OE and aneuploidy, and suggest that karyotypic heterogeneity may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of CENP-A-overexpressing cancers."

In this study, the effects of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L2) on the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) were investigated. Methods Primary tumour specimens of stage III CRC patients operated between 2002 and 2013 were assessed for PD-1 and PD-L2 expression and various clinicopathological and prognostic factors. Results We observed a significant relationship between poor prognostic factors and PD-1/PD-L2 expression. These biomarkers were also found to serve as independent risk factors for LIR and MSI. In univariate analysis, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were found to be poor in PD-1 and PD-L2 positive patients.

Patients and Methods: This project utilized publically available liver single-cell RNA-seq datasets of liver cancer and liver progenitor cell types to demonstrate how shared large amounts of data can generate new and valuable information. The data were analyzed using EdgeR differential expression analysis, with focus on a set of 34 known stemness markers. Results: We showed that the expression of stemness markers SOX9, KRT19, KRT7, and CD24, and Yamanaka factors Oct4 and SOX2 in CSCs was significantly elevated relative to progenitor cell types, potentially explaining their increased differentiation and replication potential. Conclusion: These results help to further document the complementary expression changes that give CSCs their distinct phenotypic profile. Our findings have potential significance to advance our knowledge of the important genes relevant to CSCs."

ARVib suppresses growth of advanced prostate cancer via inhibition of androgen receptor signaling	ONCOGENE			English	Article; Early Access							SPLICE VARIANTS; FULL-LENGTH; INCREASED SURVIVAL; ENZALUTAMIDE; DEGRADATION; RESISTANCE; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; PROTEOSTASIS; ABIRATERONE	"Targeting androgen signaling with the second-generation anti-androgen drugs, such as enzalutamide (Enza), abiraterone (Abi), apalutamide (Apal), and darolutamide (Daro), is the mainstay for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While these treatments are effective initially, resistance occurs frequently. Continued expression of androgen receptor (AR) and its variants such as AR-V7 despite AR-targeted therapy contributes to treatment resistance and cancer progression in advanced CRPC patients. This highlights the need for new strategies blocking continued AR signaling. Here, we identify a novel AR/AR-V7 degrader (ARVib) and found that ARVib effectively degrades AR/AR-V7 protein and attenuates AR/AR-V7 downstream target gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, ARVib degrades AR/AR-V7 protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by HSP70/STUB1 machinery modulation. ARVib suppresses HSP70 expression and promotes STUB1 nuclear translocation, where STUB1 binds to AR/AR-V7 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. ARVib significantly inhibits resistant prostate tumor growth and improves enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that ARVib has potential for development as an AR/AR-V7 degrader to treat resistant CRPC."

Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may occur, leading to more aggressive and invasive features. Herein, we evaluated the effect of the flavonoid quercetin on EMT and NIS expression in BCPAP, a papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line. BCPAP was treated with 100 mu M quercetin for 24 h and cell viability, apoptosis, EMT markers and NIS were evaluated. Quercetin decreased cell viability by enhancing apoptosis. The flavonoid also reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 and increased E-cadherin mRNA levels, inhibiting BCPAP adhesion and migration. Additionally, quercetin increased NIS expression and function.

IRS4 can induce mammary tumorigenesis and is usually overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the role of IRS4 in the development and progression of lung cancer. In this study, we show that IRS4 knockout suppresses the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells, as well as tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model. In contrast, stable expression of IRS4 showed the opposite effects. As expected, IRS4 was found to activate the PI3K/Akt and Ras-MAPK pathways, and we also showed that IRS4 depletion significantly enhanced the sensitivity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-resistant cells to gefitinib.

This is important as intercellular EV trafficking plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Here we report that overexpression of mutant RAS drives the EV internalization switch from endocytosis (in non-transformed cells) to macropinocytosis (in cancer cells) resulting in enhanced EV uptake. This process depends on the surface proteoglycan, fibronectin and EV engulfment mechanism regulated by CRAF. Both mutant RAS and activated CRAF expression is associated with formation of membrane ruffles to which they colocalize along with actin, sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) and phosphorylated myosin phosphatase (pMYPT). RAS-transformed cells internalize EVs in the vicinity of ruffled structures followed by apparent trafficking to lysosome and degradation. NHE inhibitor (EIPA) suppresses RAS-driven EV uptake, along with adhesion-independent clonal growth and experimental metastasis in mice.

KLHL38 levels positively correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and pathological tumor-node-metastasis stage (all P < 0.001). In NSCLC cell lines, KLHL38 overexpression promoted PTEN ubiquitination, thereby activating Akt signaling. It also promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by upregulating the expression of genes encoding cyclin D1, cyclin B, c-myc, RhoA, and MMP9, while downregulating the expression of p21 and E-cadherin.

Structure-based docking and 200 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that the binding of vanillin stabilizes the CDK6 structure and provides mechanistic insights into the binding mechanism. Enzyme inhibition and fluorescence-binding studies showed that vanillin inhibits CDK6 with an half maximal inhibitory concentration = 4.99 mu M and a binding constant (K) 4.1 x 10(7) M-1. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements further complemented our observations. Studies on human cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and A549) showed that vanillin decreases cell viability and colonization properties.

Current cytological methods have certain limitations for cervical cancer early screening. Light scattering patterns can reflect small differences in the internal structure of cells. In this study, we develop a light scattering pattern specific convolutional network (LSPS-net) based on deep learning algorithm and integrate it into a 2D light scattering static cytometry for automatic, label-free analysis of single cervical cells. An accuracy rate of 95.46% for the classification of normal cervical cells and cancerous ones (mixed C-33A and CaSki cells) is obtained. When applied for the subtyping of label-free cervical cell lines, we obtain an accuracy rate of 93.31% with our LSPS-net cytometric technique. Furthermore, the three-way classification of the above different types of cells has an overall accuracy rate of 90.90%, and comparisons with other feature descriptors and classification algorithms show the superiority of deep learning for automatic feature extraction.

Thus, understanding the response to HER2-HER3 signaling and the regulation of the dimer is essential to decipher therapy relapse mechanisms. Here, we investigate a bidirectional relationship between HER2-HER3 signaling and a type-1 transmembrane sorting receptor, sortilin-related receptor (SorLA; SORL1). We demonstrate that heregulin-mediated signaling supports SorLA transcription downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that SorLA interacts directly with HER3, forming a trimeric complex with HER2 and HER3 to attenuate lysosomal degradation of the dimer in a Ras-related protein Rab4-dependent manner. In line with a role for SorLA in supporting the stability of the HER2 and HER3 receptors, loss of SorLA compromised heregulin-induced cell proliferation and sensitized metastatic anti-HER2 therapy-resistant breast cancer cells to neratinib in cancer spheroids in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish brain xenograft model."

The Notch signaling pathway has different roles in many human neoplasms, being either tumor-promoting or anti-proliferative. In addition, Notch signaling in carcinogenesis can be tissue dependent. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the relation between Notch1 protein expression in lung cancer cells and the following Notch related proteins: Hes1, c-Myc, Jagged1 and Jagged2. Methods. Notch1 and its related proteins were detected in human lung cancer cell lines and in 54 surgically resected different lung carcinoma tissues. Then, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, to down-regulate the expression of Notch1 in H69AR and SBC3 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells. Also, we transfected venus Notch1 intracellular domain (v.NICD) plasmid into human SCLC lines; H69. Results. The expression of Hes1, c-Myc and Jagged2 is affected by Notch1 in SCLC. Conclusion. There is a strong association between the expression of Notch1 protein and the expression of Hes1, c-Myc and Jagged2 proteins, which could aid in better understanding tumorigenesis in SCLC."

In previous studies, the distribution and efficacy of the NSC-delivered cargo has been examined; however, the fate of the NSCs has not yet been explored.MethodsTo monitor NSC tropism, we used an unconventional method of quantifying endocytosed gold nanorods to overcome the weaknesses of existing cell-tracking technologies.ResultsHere, we report efficient tumor tropism of HB1.F3.CD21 NSCs, showing that they primarily distribute to the tumor stroma surrounding individual tumor foci within 3h after injection, reaching up to 95% of IP metastases without localizing to healthy tissue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these NSCs are non-tumorigenic and non-immunogenic within the peritoneal setting.ConclusionsTheir efficient tropism, combined with their promising clinical safety features and potential for cost-effective scale-up, positions this NSC line as a practical, off-the-shelf platform to improve the delivery of a myriad of peritoneal cancer therapeutics."

AKT plays an essential role in tumorigenesis by modulating the phosphorylation of various substrates. The activation of AKT is regulated by PTEN and PIP3. Here, we prove KNSTRN is positively correlated with malignancy of bladder cancer and KNSTRN activates AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. More importantly, our study reveals that both KNSTRN and PTEN interact with PH domain of AKT at cell membrane. The amount of KNSTRN interacted with AKT is negatively related to PTEN. Furthermore, PIP3 pull-down assay proves that KNSTRN promoted AKT movement to PIP3. These data suggest KNSTRN may activate AKT phosphorylation by promoting AKT movement to PIP3 and alleviating PTEN suppression. Based on the activation of AKT phosphorylation, our study demonstrates that KNSTRN promotes bladder cancer metastasis and gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, the effect of KNSTRN on tumorigenesis and gemcitabine resistance could be restored by AKT specific inhibitor MK2206 or AKT overexpression. In conclusion, we identify an oncogene KNSTRN that promotes tumorigenesis and gemcitabine resistance by activating AKT phosphorylation and may serve as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer."

CELL DEATH DISCOVERY			English	Article							METABOLISM; PHGDH; DEHYDROGENASE; EXPRESSION; SUPPORTS; GLYCINE; TARGET; BREAST	"To sustain their malignancy, tumour cells acquire several metabolic adaptations such as increased oxygen, glucose, glutamine, and lipids uptake. Other metabolic processes are also enhanced as part of tumour metabolic reprogramming, for example, increased serine metabolism. Serine is a non-essential amino acid that supports several metabolic processes that are crucial for the growth and survival of proliferating cells, including protein, DNA, and glutathione synthesis. Indeed, increased activity of D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the enzyme rate-limiting de novo serine synthesis, has been extensively reported in several tumours. Therefore, selective inhibition of PHGDH may represent a new therapeutic strategy for over-expressing PHGDH tumours, owing to its downstream inhibition of essential biomass production such as one-carbon units and nucleotides. This perspective article will discuss the current status of research into small molecular inhibitors against PHGDH in colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and Ewing's sarcoma. We will summarise recent studies on the development of PHGDH-inhibitors, highlighting their clinical potential as new therapeutics. It also wants to shed a light on some of the key limitations of the use of PHGDH-inhibitors in cancer treatment which are worth taking into account."

However, their comprehensive effects on cancer cell proliferation and tumour progression remain elusive. Materials and Methods CCK-8 assays were conducted to determine the viabilities of cancer cells after exposure to SeMC, chemotherapeutics or combined treatment. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and lipid peroxidation levels were assessed via fluorescence staining. The efficacy of free drugs or drug-loaded hydrogel against tumour growth was evaluated in a xenograft mouse model. Results Among tested cancer cells and normal cells, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells showed higher sensitivity to SeMC exposure. In addition, combined treatments with several types of chemotherapeutics induced synergistic lethality. SeMC promoted lipid peroxidation in A549 cells and thereby increased ROS generation. Significantly, the in vivo efficacy of combination therapy was largely potentiated by hydrogel-mediate drug delivery. Conclusions Our study reveals the selectivity of SeMC in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and develops an efficient strategy for local combination therapy."

This review presents an overview of the highlights of miR-326 in female-related diseases. To understand the impact of miR-326 on female disorders, we search all published studies about miR-326 having a high incidence in female conditions, including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, intrauterine adhesion, and multiple autoimmune diseases. We aim to learn about the mutual regulation mechanism between miR-326 and related genes and signaling pathways, as well as to elaborate on the value of miR-326 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target of female diseases.

The substantial heterogeneity in PCa presents a major challenge with respect to molecular analyses, patient stratification, and treatment. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select eight risk-CpG sites. Using an unsupervised clustering analysis, called consensus clustering, we found that patients with PCa could be divided into two subtypes (Methylation_H and Methylation_L) based on the DNA methylation status at these CpG sites. Differences in the epigenome, genome, transcriptome, disease status, immune cell composition, and function between the identified subtypes were explored using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. This analysis clearly revealed the risk characteristics of the Methylation_H subtype. Using a weighted correlation network analysis to select risk-related genes and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, we constructed a prediction signature for prognosis based on the subtype classification. We further validated its effectiveness using four public datasets. The two novel PCa subtypes and risk predictive signature developed in this study may be effective indicators of prognosis."

Upon genotoxic stress, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated and phosphorylates PTEN on residue 398. To elucidate the physiological role of this molecular event, we generated and analyzed knock-in mice expressing a mutant form of PTEN that cannot be phosphorylated by ATM (PTEN-398A). This mutation accelerated tumorigenesis in a model of HER2-positive breast cancer. Mammary tumors in bi-transgenic mice carrying MMTV-neu and Pten(398A) were characterized by DNA damage accumulation but reduced apoptosis. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of PTEN at position 398 is essential for the proper activation of the S phase checkpoint controlled by the PI3K-p27(Kip1)-CDK2 axis. Moreover, we linked these defects to the impaired ability of the PTEN-398A protein to relocalize to the plasma membrane in response to genotoxic stress. Altogether, our results uncover a novel role for ATM-dependent PTEN phosphorylation in the control of genomic stability, cell cycle progression, and tumorigenesis."

Diaphanous Related Formin 1 (DIAPH1) is an actin nucleator and also binds microtubule (MT) with high affinity. In this study, we analyzed the role of DIAPH1 in regulation of spindle MT-dynamics and CIN in HT29 and HCT-116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Our data show that down-regulation of DIAPH1 in these cell lines decreased spindle-MT speed by 50 % and the fraction of cells with misaligned and missegregated chromosomes was significantly increased. Furthermore, in HCT-116 DIAPH1 depleted cells deviation of chromosome number was elevated and the number of cells with micronuclei and cytosolic DNA was increased in both DIAPH1-knock down cell lines. In line with these results, database analysis revealed a significant correlation with low DIAPH1 mRNA expression and aneuploidy. Thus, DIAPH1 is substantially involved in the control of CIN in CRC cells. Since in vitro, DIAPH1 directly increased MT-polymerization, we assume that DIAPH1 controls CIN by regulating spindle-MT dynamics."

LINC00899 was lowly expressed in CC tissues and cells, and overexpressed LINC0089 inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells, whereas silencing of LINC00899 had the opposite effect. There is a targeting relationship between LINC0089 and miR-944. It was found that miR-944 could competitively bind with LINC00899, and LINC00899 in turn, could downregulate expression of miR-944. Moreover, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) was the target gene of miR-944. Overexpressed miR-944 inhibited ESR1 expression, yet enhanced the migration and invasion of CC cells and promoted the expression levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin while inhibiting the expression of E-cadherin.

Antimicrobial activity is essential at these sites, though the immune responses must be tightly regulated to prevent tissue destruction by inflammation. Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) is an evolutionarily conserved, pleiotropic protein expressed at mucosal surfaces, mainly by epithelial cells. SLPI inhibits proteases, exerts antimicrobial activity and inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)-mediated inflammatory gene transcription. SLPI maintains homeostasis at barrier tissues by preventing tissue destruction and regulating the threshold of inflammatory immune responses, while protecting the host from infection. However, excessive expression of SLPI in cancer cells may have detrimental consequences, as recent studies demonstrate that overexpression of SLPI increases the metastatic potential of epithelial tumors. Here, we review the varied functions of SLPI in the respiratory tract, skin, gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, and then discuss the mechanisms by which SLPI may contribute to cancer."

MPM is characterized by a silent clinical progression and a highly resistance to conventional chemo/radio-therapies. MPM patients die in a few months/years from diagnosis. Notch signaling is a well-conserved cell communication system, which regulates many biological processes. In humans, the dysregulation of Notch pathway potentially contributes to cancer onset/progression, including MPM. Metformin is the first-line drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin is proven to be an effective antitumor drug in preclinical models of different types of cancer. To date, clinical efficacy is being studied in many clinical trials. In this study, the anti-proliferative effect of metformin on MPM cells and the putative involvement of Notch1 as a mediator of metformin activities, were investigated.

To investigate the influence of a fibrotic microenvironment, we use fibroblast-derived ECM scaffolds as a cell culture platform. We uncover that estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells cultured within ECM-scaffolds have an increase in ER signaling that occurs via an MAPK-dependent, but estrogen-independent manner. The ECM acts as a reservoir by binding, enriching, and presenting growth factors to adjacent epithelial cells. We identified FGF2 as a specific ECM-bound factor that drives ER signaling. ER+ cells cultured on ECM matrices have reduced sensitivity to ER-targeted therapies. The sensitivity to ER-targeted therapy can be restored by inhibiting FGF2-FGFR1 binding. ECM-FGF2 complexes promote Cyclin D1 induction that prevents G(1) arrest even in the presence of antiestrogens. This work demonstrates that the ECM can drive ER signaling and resistance to endocrine therapy, and suggests that patients with ER+ breast cancer that have high mammographic breast density may benefit from existing FGFR-targeted therapies."

Emerging evidence indicates that TPD52 isoform 1, a prostate-specific and androgen-responsive gene, contributes to the malignant progression of PCa. Here, we demonstrate that TPD52 enhances CMA activation by interacting with HSPA8/HSC70 and enhancing substrate degradation in PCa. Elevation of TPD52 is essential for CMA-induced PCa cell proliferation and stress resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TPD52 is acetylated by KAT2B at K163, which is a process that can be antagonized by HDAC2. Inactivation of HDAC2 results in elevated TPD52 acetylation, which compromises the interaction between TPD52 and HSPA8, leading to impaired CMA function and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings reveal that acetylation-dependent regulation of TPD52 modulates CMA oncogenic function in PCa, thereby suggesting the possibility of targeting the TPD52-mediated CMA pathway to control the progression of PCa."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CSCs regulation remain largely unclear. Recently, PCNA-associated factor (PAF) was identified to play a key role in maintaining breast cancer cell stemness, but its role in liver cancer stem cells has not been declared yet. Herein, we found that both mRNA and protein expression levels of PAF were significantly higher in HCC tissues and cell lines than normal controls. CSC-enriched hepatoma spheres displayed an increase in PAF expression compared to monolayer-cultured cells. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments revealed that PAF enhanced sphere formation and the percentage of CD133(+) or EpCAM(+) cells in HCCLM3 and Huh7 cells. In the xenograft HCC tumor model, tumor initiation rates and tumor growth were suppressed by knockdown of PAF. Mechanistically, PAF can amplify the self-renewal of liver CSCs by activating beta-catenin signaling.

Practically, there are two-faced effects of STAT1 on tumorigenesis in different kinds of cancers. Existing evidence reveals that STAT1 has both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting functions involved in angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, drug resistance, stemness, and immune responses mainly through interacting and regulating target genes at multiple levels. The canonical STAT1 signaling pathway shows that STAT1 is phosphorylated and activated by the receptor-activated kinases such as Janus kinase in response to interferon stimulation. The STAT1 signaling can also be crosstalk with other signaling such as transforming growth factor-beta signaling involved in cancer cell behavior. OC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage due to symptomless or atypical symptoms and the lack of effective detection at an early stage. Furthermore, patients with OC often develop chemoresistance and recurrence.

Altered expression and distribution of members of the claudin family have been implicated in several cancers including breast cancer (BC). We performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression and prognostic value of claudins in BC using various online databases. Compared with normal tissues, CLDN3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 14 were upregulated in BC tissues, whereas CLDN2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 19, and 20 were downregulated. A high expression of CLDN2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 14-20 was associated with better relapsefree survival (RFS), whereas a high CLDN3 expression correlated with poor RFS. In addition, a high expression of CLDN3, 4, 14, and 20 was associated with poor overall survival (OS), whereas that of CLDN5 and CLDN11 was linked to a better OS. Although METABRIC and TCGA datasets revealed 22% and 27% gene alterations, respectively, in the members of the claudin family, these were not associated with survival.

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a novel potential target and STING agonists have shown potential anti-tumor efficacy. Combined therapy based on synergistic mechanism can overcome the resistance. However, STING agonists-based combination therapies are deficient. We designed different immunotherapy combinations, including STING agonist, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor and PD-1 blockade, with purpose of exploring which option can effectively inhibit CRC growth. To further explore the possible reasons of therapeutic effectiveness, we observed the combination therapy in C57BL/ 6Tmem173gt mice. Our findings demonstrated that STING agonist diABZI combined with IDO inhibitor 1-MT significantly inhibited tumor growth, even better than the three-drug combination, promoted the recruitment of CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, and decreased the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We conclude that diABZI combined with 1-MT is a promising option for CRC."

However, the whole process of cell-cell fusion is still not well understood and seems to be rather inefficient since only a certain number of (cancer) cells are capable of fusing and only a rather small population of fused tumor hybrids will survive at all. The low survivability of tumor hybrids is attributed to post-fusion processes, which are characterized by the random segregation of mixed parental chromosomes, the induction of aneuploidy and further random chromosomal aberrations and genetic/epigenetic alterations in daughter cells. As post-fusion processes also run in a unique manner in surviving tumor hybrids, the occurrence of novel properties could thus also be a random event, whereby it might be speculated that the tumor microenvironment and its spatial habitats could direct evolving tumor hybrids towards a specific phenotype."

However, its clinical benefits still remain limited. As liver metastases (LM) represent the most common metastatic site of colorectal cancer and affect approximately one-quarter of the patients diagnosed with this malignancy, its treatment is an essential aspect for patients' prognosis. Especially in the perioperative setting, the application of anti-angiogenic drugs represents a therapeutic option that may be used in case of high-risk or borderline resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) in order to achieve secondary resectability. Regarding CRCLM, one reason for the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatment may be represented by vessel co-option (VCO), which is an alternative mechanism of blood supply that differs fundamentally from the well-known sprouting angiogenesis and occurs in a significant fraction of CRCLM. In this scenario, tumor cells hijack pre-existing mature vessels of the host organ independently from stimulating new vessels formation. This represents an escape mechanism from common anti-angiogenic anti-cancer treatments, as they primarily target the main trigger of sprouting angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor A. Moreover, the mechanism of blood supply in CRCLM can be deduced from their phenotypic histopathological growth pattern (HGP). For that, a specific guideline has already been implemented. These HGP vary not only regarding their blood supply, but also concerning their tumor microenvironment (TME), as notable differences in immune cell infiltration and desmoplastic reaction surrounding the CRCLM can be observed. The latter actually serves as one of the central criteria for the classification of the HGP. Regarding the clinically relevant effects of the HGP, it is still a topic of research whether the VCO-subgroup of CRCLM results in an impaired treatment response to anti-angiogenic treatment when compared to an angiogenic subgroup. However, it is well-proved, that VCO in CRCLM generally relates to an inferior survival compared to the angiogenic subgroup. Altogether the different types of blood supply result in a relevant influence on the patients' prognosis. This reinforces the need of an extended understanding of the underlying mechanisms of VCO in CRCLM with the aim to generate more comprehensive approaches which can target tumor vessels alternatively or even other components of the TME. This review aims to augment the current state of knowledge on VCO in CRCLM and other tumor entities and its impact on anti-angiogenic anti-cancer therapy."

After revisiting the BAG3 literature published over the past ten years with Citespace software, we classified the BAG3 research into several clusters, including cancer, cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration, and viral propagation. We then highlighted recent key findings in each cluster. To gain greater insight into the roles of BAG3, we analyzed five different published mass spectrometry data sets of proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with BAG3. These data gave us insight into universal, as well as cell-type-specific BAG3 interactors in cancer cells, cardiomyocytes, and neurons. Finally, we mapped variable BAG3 SNPs and also mutation data from previous publications to further explore the link between the domains and function of BAG3.

This process is orchestrated by many complex biological interactions and processes that are mediated by a combination of anatomical, genetic, pathophysiological and biochemical factors. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly being demonstrated as critical mediators of bi-directional tumour-host cell interactions, controlling organ-specific infiltration, adaptation and colonization at the secondary site. EVs govern organotropic metastasis by modulating the pre-metastatic microenvironment through upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression and immunosuppressive cytokine secretion, induction of phenotype-specific differentiation and recruitment of specific stromal cell types. This review discusses EV-mediated metastatic organotropism in visceral (brain, lung, liver, and lymph node) and skeletal (bone) metastasis, and discusses how the pre-metastatic education by EVs transforms the organ into a hospitable, tumour cell-friendly milieu that supports the growth of metastatic cells. Decoding the organ-specific traits of EVs and their functions in organotropic metastasis is essential in accelerating the clinical application of EVs in cancer management."

Myc protein orchestrates diverse physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. Myc modulates about 15% of the global transcriptome, and its deregulation rewires the cellular signaling modules inside tumor cells, thereby acquiring selective advantages. The deregulation of Myc occurs in >70% of human cancers, and is related to poor prognosis; hence, hyperactivated Myc oncoprotein has been proposed as an ideal drug target for decades. Nevertheless, no specific drug is currently available to directly target Myc, mainly because of its undruggable properties: lack of enzymatic pocket for conventional small molecules to bind; inaccessibility for antibody due to the predominant nucleus localization of Myc. Although the topic of targeting Myc has actively been reviewed in the past decades, exciting new progresses in this field keep emerging. In this review, after a comprehensive summarization of valuable sources for potential druggable targets of Myc-driven cancer, we also peer into the promising future of utilizing macropinocytosis to deliver peptides like Omomyc or antibody agents to intracellular compartment for cancer treatment."

CYLD Alterations in the Tumorigenesis and Progression of Human Papillomavirus-Associated Head and Neck Cancers	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH			English	Review							NF-KAPPA-B; MULTIPLE FAMILIAL TRICHOEPITHELIOMAS; BROOKE-SPIEGLER-SYNDROME; CELL-PROLIFERATION; UBIQUITIN; GENE; PROMOTES; MUTATIONS; CYLINDROMATOSIS; INACTIVATION	"Genetic alterations of CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD), a tumor-suppressor gene encoding a deubiquitinase (DUB) enzyme, are associated with the formation of tumors in CYLD cutaneous syndrome. Genome sequencing efforts have revealed somatic CYLD alterations in multiple human cancers. Moreover, in cancers commonly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (e.g., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), CYLD alterations are preferentially observed in the HPV-positive versus HPV-negative form of the disease. The CYLD enzyme cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin from substrate proteins, resulting in the disassembly of key protein complexes and the inactivation of growth-promoting signaling pathways, including pathways mediated by NF-kappa B, Wnt/beta-catenin, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Loss-of-function CYLD alterations lead to aberrant activation of these signaling pathways, promoting tumorigenesis and malignant transformation. This review summarizes the association and potential role of CYLD somatic mutations in HPV-positive cancers, with particular emphasis on the role of these alterations in tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Potential therapeutic strategies for patients whose tumors harbor CYLD alterations are also discussed."

In order to develop more effective and specific strategies to treat cancer, it is of importance to understand the biology of drug targets, particularly the newly emerging ones. A comprehensive evaluation of these targets will benefit drug development with increased likelihood for success in clinical trials. The folate-mediated one-carbon (1C) metabolism pathway has drawn renewed attention as it is often hyperactivated in cancer and inhibition of this pathway displays promise in developing anticancer treatment with fewer side effects. Here, we systematically review individual enzymes in the 1C pathway and their compartmentalization to mitochondria and cytosol. Based on these insight, we conclude that (1) except the known 1C targets (DHFR, GART, and TYMS), MTHFD2 emerges as good drug target, especially for treating hematopoietic cancers such as CLL, AML, and T-cell lymphoma; (2) SHMT2 and MTHFD1L are potential drug targets; and (3) MTHFD2L and ALDH1L2 should not be considered as drug targets. We highlight MTHFD2 as an excellent therapeutic target and SHMT2 as a complementary target based on structural/biochemical considerations and up-to-date inhibitor development, which underscores the perspectives of their therapeutic potential."

Thus, it is urgent to explore a new treatment for TNBC. Results: MiR-106a-5p was up-regulated in TNBC tissues and cells, and was positively correlated with the tumor grade, which indicated poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transport miR106a-5p into TNBC cells via exosomes. Functional analysis showed exo-miR-106a-5p secreted by MSCs promoted tumor progression in TNBC cells. Furthermore, lncRNA HAND2-AS1 inhibited miR-106a-5p levels, and HAND2-AS1 was decreased in TNBC tissues and cells. Besides, overexpression of HAND2-AS1 reduced the secretion of exo-miR-106a-5p secretion from MSCs, thus suppressed TNBC development. Conclusion: Our study revealed that HAND2-AS1 inhibited the growth of TNBC, which were mediated by the inhibitory effects of MSC-derived exosomal miR-106a-5p."

However, how signalling integration is regulated and whether the endocytic fate of single receptors controls such signalling integration remains poorly elucidated. Combining quantitative phosphoproteomics and targeted assays, we generated a detailed picture of recycling-dependent fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling in breast cancer cells, with a focus on distinct FGF receptors (FGFRs). We discovered reciprocal priming between FGFRs and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) that is coordinated at recycling endosomes. FGFR recycling ligands induce EGFR phosphorylation on threonine 693. This phosphorylation event alters both FGFR and EGFR trafficking and primes FGFR-mediated proliferation but not cell invasion. In turn, FGFR signalling primes EGF-mediated outputs via EGFR threonine 693 phosphorylation. This reciprocal priming between distinct families of RTKs from recycling endosomes exemplifies a novel signalling integration hub where recycling endosomes orchestrate cellular behaviour. Therefore, targeting reciprocal priming over individual receptors may improve personalized therapies in breast and other cancers."

In this study, SCRIB was found to be highly expressed in CRC patients, and it was often associated with malignant characteristics, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, we found that SCRIB may interact with the Hippo signalling pathway and affect the phosphorylation of YAP and its distribution inside and outside of the nucleus. We concluded that increased expression of SCRIB is likely to inhibit the Hippo signalling pathway by promoting YAP phosphorylation.

However, the role of tumor expressed-CD38 on neoplastic formation and progression remains elusive. In the present study, we aimed to delineate the molecular and biochemical function of the tumor-associated CD38 in lung adenocarcinoma progression. Our clinical data showed that the upregulation of tumor-originated CD38 was correlated with poor survival of lung cancer patients. Using multiple in vitro assays we found that the enzymatic activity of tumor expressed-CD38 facilitated lung cancer cell migration, proliferation, colony formation, and tumor development. Consistently, our in vivo results showed that inhibition of the enzymatic activity or antagonizing the enzymatic product of CD38 resulted in the similar inhibition of tumor proliferation and metastasis as CD38 gene knock-out or mutation. At biochemical level, we further identified that cADPR, the mainly hydrolytic product of CD38, was responsible for inducing the opening of TRPM2 iron channel leading to the influx of intracellular Ca2+ and then led to increasing levels of NRF2 while decreasing expression of KEAP1 in lung cancer cells. These findings suggested that malignant lung cancer cells were capable of using cADPR catalyzed by CD38 to facilitate tumor progression, and blocking the enzymatic activity of CD38 could be represented as an important strategy for preventing tumor progression."

Differential expression of microRNAs is associated with various cancers including PCa. Although mature microRNAs are preferentially located in the cytoplasm, several studies identified mature human microRNAs in purified nuclei and miR-145 has been found to be predominantly expressed in the nuclei of benign tissues compared to tumor lesions. However, the nuclear functions of miR-145 are yet limited. Here, we aimed at investigating the inductive role of miR-145 on the expression of Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) in PCa cell lines. To study the regulatory potential of miR-145 in the transcriptional level in PCa, we overexpressed miR-145 in PC3 and DU145 cells, and confirmed its upregulation by quantitative-real-time-PCR. Then we investigated the tumor suppressor potential of miR-145 upon inducing SEMA3A expression using cell viability assay, western blot analysis, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay and luciferase reporter assay. Our results revealed that p53, miR-145, and SEMA3A expressions are significantly downregulated in PC3 and DU145 cells compared to nontumorigenic prostate epithelial PNT1a cells. miR-145 overexpression in PCa cells induced the expression of SEMA3A at both messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, increased miR-145 expression enriched RNA Pol-II antibody on the promoter of SEMA3A and induced luciferase activity controlled by SEMA3A promoter.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a type of ceRNA constitute a competitive regulatory network determined by miRNA response elements (MREs). Mutations in lncRNA MREs destabilize their original regulatory pathways. Study of the effects of lncRNA somatic mutations on ceRNA mechanisms can clarify tumor mechanisms and contribute to the development of precision medicine. Here, we used somatic mutation profiles collected from TCGA to characterize the role of lncRNA somatic mutations in the ceRNA regulatory network in 33 cancers. The 31,560 mutation sites identified by TargetScan and miRanda affected the balance of 70,811 ceRNA regulatory pathways. Putative mutations were categorized as high or low based on mutation frequencies. Multivariate multiple regression revealed a significant effect of 162 high-frequency mutations in six cancer types on the expression levels of target mRNAs (ceMs) through the ceRNA mechanism. Low-frequency mutations in multiple cancers perturbing 1624 ceM have been verified by Student's t-test, indicating a significant mechanism of changes in the expression level of oncogenic genes. Oncogenic signaling pathway studies involving ceMs indicated functional heterogeneity of multiple cancers. Furthermore, we identified that lncRNA, perturbing ceMs associated with patient survival, have potential as biomarkers. Our collective findings revealed individual differences in somatic mutations perturbing ceM expression and impacting tumor heterogeneity."

Here, we identified the TME-related gene, plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2), in a high-stromal-score population. And we revealed that this gene was related to poor survival and advanced (tumor-node-metastasis) stage in gastric cancer (GC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. An integrated gene profile and functional analysis of the proportions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells revealed that the expression of the M2 macrophages cell marker CD163 was positively correlated with PLXDC2 expression. In addition, the M2 macrophages gene signature and high PLXDC2 expression were associated with the inflammatory signaling pathway and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related gene signature. Single-cell study of GC identified PLXDC2 was enriched specifically in fibroblasts and monocytes/macrophages populations, which supported its important role in the stroma. Furthermore, according to a tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis, the expression of PLXDC2 elevated in human GC stromal specimens compared to tumor tissue specimens. Moreover, PLXDC2 overexpression in the stromal compartment was associated with CD163-positive regulatory M2 macrophages, and its functions were related to the pathogenesis of GC. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry verified PLXDC2's correlation with EMT markers. Our data suggested that PLXDC2 was expressed in stromal cells and that its crosstalk with tumor-associated macrophages could contribute to cancer biology by inducing the EMT process."

Liver metastasis is an important factor affecting the long-term prognosis of CRC and the specific mechanism of CRLM (colorectal cancer with liver metastasis) is not fully understood. LZTS1 has been found dysregulated in many cancers, especially in CRC. Theories suggested that hypermethylation of the promoter regions of LZTS1 was responsible for LZTS1 abnormal expression in multiple malignant tumors. Although the role of LZTS1 in CRC cell proliferation has been reported, its role in CRLM remains unclear. Numerous studies reported Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) could regulate the gene expression level by regulating gene methylation status in many tumors. However, whether there were lncRNAs could change the methylation status of LZTS1 or not in CRLM was unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there are lncRNAs can regulate the expression of LZTS1 through affecting DNA methylation in CRLM. We found that upregulated Lnc-LALC in CRC was negatively correlated with LZTS1 expression, and Lnc-LALC could regulate LZTS1 expression in both mRNA and protein level in our study. Functionally, Lnc-LALC enhanced the CRC cells metastasis ability in vitro and vivo through inhibiting the expression of LZTS1. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms exploration showed that lnc-LALC could recruit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to the LZTS1 promoter by combining with Enhancer of zeste homolog 2(EZH2) and then altered the expression of LZTS1 via DNMTs-mediated DNA methylation. Collectively, our data demonstrated the important role of Lnc-LALC/ LZTS1 axis in CRLM development."

Moreover, previous reports noted that Prame functions as a substrate recognizing receptor protein of Cullin RING E3 ligases (CRLs) to mediate potential substrates degradation through Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). However, none of the Prame specific substrate has been identified so far. In this study, proteomic analysis of RBX1-interacting proteins revealed p14/ARF, a well-known tumor suppressor, as a novel ubiquitin target of RBX1. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation and in vivo ubiquitination assay determined Cullin2-RBX1-Transcription Elongation Factor B Subunit 2 (EloB) assembled CRL2 E3 ligase complex to regulate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p14/ARF. Finally, through siRNA screening, Prame was identified as the specific receptor protein responsible for recognizing p14/ARF to be degraded. Additionally, via bioinformatics analysis of TCGA database and clinical samples, Prame was determined to overexpress in tumor tissues vs. paired adjacent tissues and associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. As such, downregulation of Prame expression significantly restrained cancer cell growth by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, which could be rescued by simultaneously knocking down of p14/ARF. Altogether, targeting overexpressed Prame in cancer cells inactivated RBX1-Cullin2-EloB-Prame E3 ligase (CRL2(Prame)) and halted p14/ARF degradation to restrain tumor growth by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest."

Fibulin-3 is a matrix glycoprotein that displays potential for tumor suppression or propagation. The present study aimed to validate the expression levels of survivin and fibulin-3 in benign and malignant respiratory diseases. This case-control study included 219 patients categorized into five groups. Group A included 63 patients with lung cancer, group B included 63 patients with various benign lung diseases, group D included 45 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and group E included 48 patients with various benign pleural diseases. Group C included 60 healthy individuals (control group). Serum survivin and fibulin-3 levels were measured by ELISA, whereas their nuclear expressions in the lung and pleura were assessed via Western blot analysis. The results showed significantly higher survivin serum levels and significantly lower fibulin-3 levels in group A compared with in group B and controls (P < 0.001). There were significantly higher serum levels of survivin and fibulin-3 in group D compared with in group E and controls (P<.0.001), consistent with observed nuclear survivin and fibulin-3 expression levels.

In this study, our data showed that M1 macrophages attenuate, while M2 macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages enhance the EGFR-TKIs resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H1975. Next, long non-coding RNA SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) is highly expressed in NSCLC cells-derived exosomes. NSCLC cells-derived exosomes promote macrophages M2 polarization and inhibit M1 polarization through transferring SOX2-OT to macrophages. Subsequently, our results indicated that NSCLC cells-induced M2-polarized macrophages enhance the EGFR-TKIs resistance in H1975 cells. Furthermore, our data revealed that NSCLC cells-derived exosomes inhibit the expression of miR-627-3p, while promote Smads expression in THP-1 cells. SOX2-OT acts as miR-627-3p sponge to facilitate Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 expression. Finally, our results indicated that NSCLC cells promote macrophages M2 polarization and suppress M1 polarization through targeting miR-627-3p/Smads signaling pathway by transferring exosomes to THP-1 cells. In conclusion, our data revealed that NSCLC cells promote macrophages M2 polarization through transferring exosomal SOX2-OT, thus to enhance its own EGFR-TKIs resistance. Mechanismly, NSCLC cells-derived exosomal SOX2-OT promotes macrophages M2 polarization via promoting Smads by sponging miR-627-3p.

Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a pivotal role in various cancers recently. Our present study focused on exploring the function of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00473 (LINC00473) in GC. In this study, we found that LINC00473 expression was aberrantly increased in tumor tissues compared with the paired para-cancerous tissues. The expression of high LINC00473 in GC was notably correlated with a higher risk of lymphatic metastasis, a higher incidence of vascular cancer embolus, and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments showed that the overexpression of LINC00473 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The apoptosis of GC cells increased significantly by the decrease of LINC00473. Mechanistically, LINC00473 could sponge miR-16-5p in the cytoplasm and relieve its suppression of CCND2. Moreover, AQP3 was found to be a significant downstream target gene for LINC00473 through RNA transcriptome sequencing, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Overexpression of LINC00473 can partially reverse the effects of AQP3 decrease on GC proliferation and metastasis. LINC00473 regulated AQP3 expression through CREB was confirmed by western blot. Our research indicates that LINC00473/miR-16-5p/CCND2 axis plays a role in the proliferation of GC and modulates AQP3 to influence GC cell metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for GC."

The current study aimed to explore the regulatory effects of ring finger protein 144A (RNF144A), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the maintenance of CSC properties and tumor development in EOC. Methods The expressions of RNF144A in EOC tissue samples and cells were examined. The knockdown or overexpression of a target gene was achieved by transfecting EOC cells with short hairpin RNA or adenoviral vectors. A mouse xenograft model was constructed by inoculating nude mice with EOC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine the interaction between RNF144A and LIN28B. Results Downregulated RNF144A expression was observed in ovarian tumor tissues and EOC cells. Low RNF144A expression was positively associated with poor survival of EOC patients. RNF144A knockdown significantly enhanced sphere formation and upregulated stem cell markers in EOC cells, while RNF144A overexpression prevented EOC cells from acquiring stem cell properties. Also, the upregulation of RNF144A inhibited ovarian tumor growth and aggressiveness in cell culture and mouse xenografts. Further analysis revealed that RNF144A induced LIN28B degradation through ubiquitination in EOC cells. LIN28B upregulation restored the expressions of stem cell pluripotency-associated transcription factors in EOC cells overexpressing RNF144A. Conclusion Taken together, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of restoring RNF144A expression and thereby suppressing LIN28B-associated oncogenic signaling for EOC treatment."

Chromosomal instability in highly metastatic cells releases fragmented chromosomal parts in the cytoplasm, hence the activation of STING via an increased level of cyclic dinucleotides (cDNs) synthesized by cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Cyclic dinucleotides 2' 3'-cGAMP and it's analog can potentially activate STING mediated pathways leading to nuclear translocation of p65 and IRF-3 and transcription of inflammatory genes. The differential modulation of STING pathway via 2' 3'-cGAMP and its analog and its implication in breast tumorigenesis is still not well explored. In the current study, we demonstrated that c-di-AMP can activate type-1 IFN response in ER negative breast cancer cell lines which correlate with STING expression. c-di-AMP binds to STING and activates downstream IFN pathways in STING positive metastatic MDA-MB-231/MX-1 cells. Prolonged treatment of c-di-AMP induces cell death in STING positive metastatic MDA-MB-231/MX-1 cells mediated by IRF-3. c-di-AMP induces IRF-3 translocation to mitochondria and initiates Caspase-9 mediated cell death and inhibits clonogenicity of triple-negative breast cancer cells. This study suggests that c-di-AMP can activate and modulates STING pathway to induce mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer cells."

Investigating differences between tamoxifen resistant and sensitive breast cancer cells with flow cytometry	CYTOMETRY PART A			English	Article						breast cancer; chemoresistance; integrin beta 1; tamoxifen		"The active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, functions as an anti-estrogen in breast cancer cells and thus inhibits proliferation. While tamoxifen continues to be successfully used to treat estrogen-dependent breast cancer, most patients receiving treatment will develop chemoresistance over time. Two commonly reported biomarkers of tamoxifen resistance are decreased expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In prior work we have shown that these receptors facilitate chemoresistance and have unique regulatory functions measurable in resistant cell lines compared with nonresistant. Thus, we hypothesized that these receptors and a newly identified biomarker, integrin beta 1, may be used to search for the presence of resistant breast cancer cells within a population of cells that are sensitive to tamoxifen therapy. We tested this by designing a straightforward cell-labeling approach to measure differences in the receptor expression of resistant vs. sensitive cells cytometrically. Our results show that separation is possible when observing the expression of IGF-1R as well as integrin beta 1. Interestingly, we found no detectable difference in EGFR expression between tamoxifen resistant and -sensitive cells when measured with cytometry despite the fact that EGFR is upregulated in resistant cells. Our long-term goal is to utilize sorting to isolate tamoxifen resistant subpopulations of cells by receptor expression level. Isolating rare resistant cells that reside within a population of drug-sensitive cells will offer new insights into why chemoresistance occurs."

Unique features of exosomes make them an appropriate carrier for drug delivery. miRNA-381 is one of the downregulated miRNAs in several cancers including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and restoration of its expression in TNBC cells can restrict their migratory ability through targeting several signaling pathways. In current study, we exploited the exosomes isolated from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC-exosomes) to deliver miR-381 mimic to MDA-MB-231 cells to elucidate their effects on TNBC cells. The effects of miR-381 loaded ADMSC-exosomes on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed.

A deregulation of the NAD(+) levels has been associated with metabolic diseases and aging-related diseases, including neurodegeneration, defective immune responses, and cancer. NAD(+) acts as a cofactor through its interplay with NADH, playing an essential role in many enzymatic reactions of energy metabolism, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and the TCA cycle. NAD(+) also plays a role in deacetylation by sirtuins and ADP ribosylation during DNA damage/repair by PARP proteins. Finally, different NAD hydrolase proteins also consume NAD(+) while converting it into ADP-ribose or its cyclic counterpart. Some of these proteins, such as CD38, seem to be extensively involved in the immune response. Since NAD cannot be taken directly from food, NAD metabolism is essential, and NAMPT is the key enzyme recovering NAD from nicotinamide and generating most of the NAD cellular pools. Because of the complex network of pathways in which NAD(+) is essential, the important role of NAD(+) and its key generating enzyme, NAMPT, in cancer is understandable. In the present work, we review the role of NAD(+) and NAMPT in the ways that they may influence cancer metabolism, the immune system, stemness, aging, and cancer. Finally, we review some ongoing research on therapeutic approaches."

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and anti-inflammatory drugs are potential treatment options. These treatment options lead to systemic toxicity, acquired tumor resistance and the emergence of drug-resistant stem cells. A colonic epithelial cell culture model expressing the relevant genetic defects in chemo-resistant stem cells provides a relevant experimental system for HNPCC. Objective: To develop a colonic epithelial cell culture system from a mouse model for HNPCC and to isolate and characterize drug-resistant stem cells. Experimental Models and Biomarkers: The Mlh(1)( [-/-]/)Apc([-/-]) Mlh(1)/1638N COL-Cl-1 cells is a mouse model for HNPCC, and the 5-fluoro-uracil resistant (5-FU-R) phenotype represents a model for the drug-resistant stem cells. Tumor spheroid formation, and the expression of CD44, CD133 and c-Myc represent stem cell markers. Results: The HNPCC model exhibits aneuploidy, hyper-proliferation, accelerated cell cycle progression and downregulated cellular apoptosis. Long-term exposure to 5-FU selects for the drug-resistant phenotype. These resistant cells exhibit increased formation of tumor spheroids and upregulated expression of cancer stem cell markers CD44, CD133 and c-Myc. Conclusion: In the present study, a stem cell model for HNPCC was validated and offered a novel experimental approach to test stem cell-targeted alternatives to drug-resistant therapy."

The regulatory mechanisms of trastuzumab-elicited immune response in the tumor microenvironment remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we found that the nonclassical histocompatibility antigen HLA-G desensitizes breast cancer cells to trastuzumab by binding to the natural killer (NK) cell receptor KIR2DL4. Unless engaged by HLA-G, KIR2DL4 promotes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and forms a regulatory circuit with the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production pathway, in which IFN-gamma upregulates KIR2DL4 via JAK2/STAT1 signaling, and then KIR2DL4 synergizes with the Fc gamma receptor to increase IFN-gamma secretion by NK cells. Trastuzumab treatment of neoplastic and NK cells leads to aberrant cytokine production characterized by excessive tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and IFN-gamma, which subsequently reinforce HLA-G/KIR2DL4 signaling. In addition, TGF-beta and IFN-gamma impair the cytotoxicity of NK cells by upregulating PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on NK cells. Blockade of HLA-G/KIR2DL4 signaling improved the vulnerability of HER2-positive breast cancer to trastuzumab treatment in vivo. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying trastuzumab resistance and demonstrate the applicability of combined HLA-G and PD-L1/PD-1 targeting in the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer."

Several deregulated signaling pathways are implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Therefore we have inclined our research towards exploring the anticancerous efficacy of a very potent phytocompound for modulating the incontinent expression of these two crucial E6 and E7 oncogenes. Further, inhibitory efficacy of rutin against human papillomavirus (HPV)-E6 and E7 oncoproteins in cervical cancer has not been elucidated yet. This research addresses the growth inhibitory efficacy of rutin against E6 and E7 oncoproteins in HeLa cells, which is known to inactivate several tumor suppressor proteins such as p53 and pRB. Rutin treatment exhibited reduced cell viability with increased cell accumulation in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle in HeLa cell lines. Additionally, rutin treatment has also led to down-regulation of E6 and E7 expression associated with an increased expression of p53 and pRB levels. This has further resulted in enhanced Bax expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression releasing cytochrome c into cytosol followed by caspase cascade activation with cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Further, in silico studies have also supported our in vitro findings by exhibiting significant binding energy against selected target oncoproteins. Therefore, our research findings might recommend rutin as one of the potent drug candidate in cervical cancer management via targeting two crucial oncoproteins associated with viral progression."

Deterioration of DUSP6 expression could therefore result in deregulated growth activity. We have previously discovered ACA-28, a novel anticancer compound with a unique property to stimulate ERK phosphorylation and induce apoptosis in ERK-active melanoma cells. However, the mechanism of cancer cell-specific-apoptosis by ACA-28 remains obscure. Here, we investigated the involvement of DUSP6 in the mechanisms of the ACA-28-mediated apoptosis by using the NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing HER2/ErbB2 (A4-15 cells), as A4-15 exhibited higher ERK phosphorylation and are more susceptible to ACA-28 than NIH/3T3. We showed that A4-15 exhibited high DUSP6 protein levels, which require ERK activation. Notably, the silencing of the DUDSP6 gene by siRNA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in A4-15, but not in NIH/3T3, indicating that A4-15 requires high DUSP6 expression for growth. Importantly, ACA-28 preferentially down-regulated the DUSP6 protein and proliferation in A4-15 via the proteasome, while it stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Collectively, the up-regulation of DUSP6 may exert a growth-promoting role in cancer cells overexpressing HER2. DUSP6 down-regulation in ERK-active cancer cells might have the potential as a novel cancer measure."

A long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) gastric cancer-associated lncRNA1 (GClnc1) has been revealed to play critical roles in metastasis. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the correlation between GClnc1 and the metastasis and progression of EOC. Methods: First, 57 paired EOC and paracancerous tissues were collected to detect GClnc1 expression by RT-qPCR. Subsequently, OVC1 and SKOV3 cells with GClnc1 silencing/overexpression were developed to detect changes in cell activity, apoptosis, migration and invasion abilities. Then, the subcellular localization of GClnc1 was detected by nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation, ISH and FISH assays. The binding relationships between GClnc1 and forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2), and between FOXC2 and NOTCH1 were predicted and verified. Results: GClnc1 was significantly overexpressed in EOC tissues, and knockdown of GClnc1 inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, GClnc1 in the nucleus bound to the transcription factor FOXC2, thereby activating the transcription of NOTCH1. NOTCH1 overexpression enhanced the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of SKOV3 and OVC1 cells. Moreover, NOTCH1 activated the NF-kappa B/Snail signaling. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that GClnc1 knockdown suppressed the growth and metastasis of SKOV3 and OVC1 cells in vivo. Conclusions: GClnc1 promoted NOTCH1 transcription by recruiting FOXC2, thereby activating the NF-kappa B/Snail signaling and promoting EOC cell growth and metastasis."

Mitochondrial biogenesis is increased in ovarian cancer tissues, which is accompanied by alteration of mitochondrial energy metabolism, structure, and dynamics. These factors are involved in tumorigenesis and apoptosis resistance, highlighting the role of mitochondria in resisting cisplatin toxicity. Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells are dependent on mitochondrial OXPHOS for energy supply, and intracellular PGC1 alpha-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis levels are increased in this cell line, indicating the important role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cisplatin resistance. As PGC1 alpha is a key molecule for integrating and coordinating nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA transcriptional machinery, an investigation into the regulatory mechanism PGC1 alpha in mitochondrial energy metabolism via transcription may provide new clues for solving chemotherapy resistance. In the present study, it was demonstrated that inhibiting the expression of PGC1 alpha decreased nuclear and mitochondrial DNA transcription factor expression, leading to increased lactic acid production and decreased cellular oxygen consumption and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, mitochondrial stress-induced ROS production, as a feedback signal from mitochondria to the cell nucleus, increased PGC1 alpha expression in SKOV3/DDP cells, which was involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation regulation. Collectively, the present study provides evidence that PGC1 alpha-mediated nuclear and mitochondrial transcription feedback regulates energy metabolism and is involved in ovarian cancer cells escaping apoptosis during cisplatin treatment."

However, it is often associated with toxic side effects and chemoresistance in breast cancer patients, which greatly limits the clinical utility of the drug. Hence, compounds that act in concert with taxol to promote cytotoxicity may be useful to improve the efficacy of taxol-based chemotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that mdivi-1, a putative inhibitor of mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, enhances the anticancer effects of taxol and overcomes taxol resistance in a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231). Not only did mdivi-1 induce mitotic spindle abnormalities and mitotic arrest when used alone, but it also enhanced taxol-induced antimitotic effects when applied in combination. In addition, mdivi-1 induced pronounced spindle abnormalities and cytotoxicity in a taxol-resistant cell line, indicating that it can overcome taxol resistance. Notably, the antimitotic effects of mdivi-1 were not accompanied by prominent morphological or functional alterations in mitochondria and were Drp1-independent. Instead, mdivi-1 exhibited affinity to tubulin at mu M level, inhibited tubulin polymerization, and immediately disrupted spindle assembly when cells entered mitosis. Together, our results show that mdivi-1 associates with tubulin and impedes tubulin polymerization, actions which may underlie its antimitotic activity and its ability to enhance taxol cytotoxicity and overcome taxol resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, our data imply a possibility that mdivi-1 could be useful to improve the therapeutic efficacy of taxol in breast cancer."

ERO1 deficiency reduced tumor cell migration and lung metastases by impinging on tumor angiogenesis, negatively regulating the upstream ATF4/CHOP branch of the UPR and selectively impeding oxidative folding of angiogenic factors, among which VEGF-A. Thus, ERO1 deficiency acted synergistically with the otherwise feeble curative effects of anti-angiogenic therapy in aggressive breast cancer murine models and it might be exploited to treat cancers with pathological HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis. Furthermore, ERO1 levels are higher in the more aggressive basal breast tumors and correlate inversely with the disease- and metastasis-free interval of breast cancer patients. Thus, taking advantage of our in vitro data on ERO1-regulated gene products we identified a gene set associated with ERO1 expression in basal tumors and related to UPR, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, whose levels might be investigated in patients as a hallmark of tumor aggressiveness and orient those with lower levels toward an effective anti-angiogenic therapy."

It is usually present in cells as a tetrameric enzyme, composed of two catalytic (alpha or alpha') and two regulatory (beta) subunits, but it is active also in its monomeric form, and the specific role of the different isoforms is largely unknown. CK2 phosphorylates several substrates related to the uncontrolled proliferation, motility, and survival of cancer cells. As a consequence, tumor cells are addicted to CK2, relying on its activity more than healthy cells for their life, and exploiting it for developing multiple oncological hallmarks. However, little is known about CK2 contribution to the metabolic rewiring of cancer cells. With this study we aimed at shedding some light on it, especially focusing on the CK2 role in the glycolytic onco-phenotype. By analyzing neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma cell lines depleted of either one (alpha) or the other (alpha') CK2 catalytic subunit, we also aimed at disclosing possible pro-tumor functions which are specific of a CK2 isoform. Our results suggest that both CK2 alpha and alpha' contribute to cell proliferation, survival and tumorigenicity. The analyzed metabolic features disclosed a role of CK2 in tumor metabolism, and suggest prominent functions for CK2 alpha isoform. Results were also confirmed by CK2 pharmacological inhibition. Overall, our study provides new information on the mechanism of cancer cells addiction to CK2 and on its isoform-specific functions, with fundamental implications for improving future therapeutic strategies based on CK2 targeting."

Methods Detection of HCP5, miR-186-5p, and WNT5A expression in clinical GC tissues and adjacent healthy tissues was performed, followed by Pearson correlation analysis. BGC-823 and AGS cells, with interferences of HCP5, miR-186-5p, and WNT5A, were cultured under hypoxia. MTT, colony formation assay, Caspase-3 activity assay, and transwell assay were applied for the determination of cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis, and invasion, respectively. Expressions of WNT5A and protein markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cells were detected by western blotting. And the binding of HCP5 and WNT5A to miR-186-5p was validated using dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results In GC tissues, an increase in HCP5 and WNT5A expressions and a reduction in miR-186-5p expression were found, and the negative correlation between miR-186-5p and HCP5/WNT5A was proven. Subsequently, under hypoxia, an increase in HCP5 and WNT5A expressions and a decrease in miR-186-5p expression in GC cells were confirmed. In addition, in GC cells under hypoxia, the inhibition of HCP5 suppressed cell biological activity and EMT, while the inhibition of miR-186-5p or the overexpression of WNT5A led to the opposite changes. Conclusion An upregulation of WNT5A expression by HCP5 competitively binding to miR-186-5p promotes GC cell development."

Disseminated ER+ tumor cells can remain viable but quiescent for years to decades. Contributing factors to metastatic spread include the maintenance and expansion of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Breast CSCs frequently exist as a minority population in therapy resistant tumors. In this study, we show that cytoplasmic complexes composed of steroid receptor (SR) co-activators, PELP1 and SRC-3, modulate breast CSC expansion through upregulation of the HIF-activated metabolic target genes PFKFB3 and PFKFB4. Seahorse metabolic assays demonstrated that cytoplasmic PELP1 influences cellular metabolism by increasing both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. PELP1 interacts with PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 proteins, and inhibition of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 kinase activity blocks PELP1-induced tumorspheres and protein-protein interactions with SRC-3. PFKFB4 knockdown inhibited in vivo emergence of circulating tumor cell (CTC) populations in mammary intraductal (MIND) models. Application of PFKFB inhibitors in combination with ER targeted therapies blocked tumorsphere formation in multiple models of advanced breast cancer including tamoxifen (TamR) and paclitaxel (TaxR) resistant models, murine tumor cells, and ER+ patient-derived organoids (PDxO). Together, our data suggest that PELP1, SRC-3, and PFKFBs cooperate to drive ER+ tumor cell populations that include CSCs and CTCs. Identifying non-ER pharmacological targets offers a useful approach to blocking metastatic escape from standard of care ER/estrogen (E2)-targeted strategies to overcome endocrine and chemotherapy resistance."

Women with relatively high mammographic density for their age and body mass index are at significantly higher risk for breast cancer. The association between mammographic density and breast cancer risk is well-established, however the molecular and cellular events that lead to the development of high mammographic density are yet to be elucidated. Puberty is a critical time for breast development, where endocrine and paracrine signalling drive development of the mammary gland epithelium, stroma, and adipose tissue. As the relative abundance of these cell types determines the radiological appearance of the adult breast, puberty should be considered as a key developmental stage in the establishment of mammographic density. Epidemiological studies have pointed to the significance of pubertal adipose tissue deposition, as well as timing of menarche and thelarche, on adult mammographic density and breast cancer risk. Activation of hypothalamicpituitary axes during puberty combined with genetic and epigenetic molecular determinants, together with stromal fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and immune signalling factors in the mammary gland, act in concert to drive breast development and the relative abundance of different cell types in the adult breast. Here, we discuss the key cellular and molecular mechanisms through which pubertal mammary gland development may affect adult mammographic density and cancer risk."

Apart from the critical role in a deluge of pathological processes, some mRNAs, in particular, microRNAs (miRNAs), are also involved in the anti-tumor activity. Therefore, our research focused on the possible effects of curcumin on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and drew a comprehensive transcriptomes profile by high throughput sequencing to understand the molecular mechanism of curcumin as an anti-tumor agent. Methods First, we calculated the apoptosis rate of H446 cells (a human SCLC cell line) cultured with curcumin. The high output sequencing uncovered the altered expression profile of genes and miRNAs. KEGG analysis selected the potential signal pathway associated with the antiproliferative property of curcumin. Finally, miRNAs significantly changed, as well as the regulatory roles of those miRNAs in cell apoptosis were determined. Result The apoptosis rate of H446 cells increased under the elevated concentration of curcumin treatment. And cell cycle-related genes downregulated in the curcumin-treated cells. Besides, miRNA-548ah-5p of a high level acted as a negative role in the anticarcinogenic activity of curcumin. Conclusion Our findings not only enriched the understanding of anti-tumor activity initiated by curcumin through figuring out the downregulated cell cycle-related pathways but also shed light on its novel therapeutic application."

Here we report that AMPK inhibits TGF-beta 1 production. First, metformin reduced mRNA levels of TGF-beta 1 in gastric cancer cells, in parallel to the decrease of its protein abundance. The effects were more prominent in the cells containing LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK. Second, knockdown of Smad3 by siRNA abrogated the expression of TGF-beta 1. Third, metformin suppressed firefly luciferase activity whose transcription was driven by TGF-beta 1 promoter. In accordance, deletion of the putative binding site of Smad3 in the TGF-beta 1 promoter region severely impaired the promoter activity and response to metformin. Fourth, in support of our in vitro study, clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes with metformin significantly reduced the plasma level of TGF-beta 1. Finally, immunohistochemical studies revealed that TGF-beta 1 was highly expressed in human gastric cancer tissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues. In contrast, p-AMPK exhibited opposite changes. Furthermore, the survival rate of gastric cancer patients was positively correlated with p-AMPK and negative with TGF-beta 1. Therefore, our present studies depict a mechanism underlying AMPK suppression of TGF-beta 1 autoinduction, which is mediated through inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation and activation. Collectively, our study sheds a light on the potential usage of AMPK activators in the treatment of TGF-beta 1-mediated gastric cancer progression."

The ionizing radiation causes genetic changes and results in cell death. However, since the biological mechanism of radiation remains unclear, there is a pressing need to understand this mechanism to improve the killing effect on tumors and reduce the side effects on normal cells. DNA break and epigenetic remodeling can be induced by radiotherapy. Hence the modulation of histone modification enzymes may tune the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. For instance, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors sensitize irradiated cancer cells by amplifying the DNA damage signaling and inhibiting double-strand DNA break repair to influence the irradiated cells' survival. However, the combination of epigenetic drugs and radiotherapy has only been evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials for limited cancer types, partly due to a lack of knowledge on the potential mechanisms on how radiation induces epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling. Here, we review recent advances of radiotherapy and radiotherapy-induced epigenetic remodeling and introduce related technologies for epigenetic monitoring. Particularly, we exploit the application of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors to visualize dynamic epigenetic regulations in single living cells and tissue upon radiotherapy and drug treatment. We aim to bridge FRET biosensor, epigenetics, and radiotherapy, providing a perspective of using FRET to assess epigenetics and provide guidance for radiotherapy to improve cancer treatment. In the end, we discuss the feasibility of a combination of epigenetic drugs and radiotherapy as new approaches for cancer therapeutics."

While mechanical loading can suppress obesity and tumor-driven osteolysis, its effect on bone-metastasized obese mice has not been investigated. Here, we hypothesized that mechanical loading can lessen obesity-associated bone degradation in tumor-invaded bone by regulating the fate of bone marrow-derived cells. In this study, the effects of mechanical loading in obese mice were evaluated through X-ray imaging, histology, cytology, and molecular analyses. Tumor inoculation to the tibia elevated body fat composition, osteolytic lesions, and tibia destruction, and these pathologic changes were stimulated by the high-fat diet (HFD). However, mechanical loading markedly reduced these changes. It suppressed osteoclastogenesis by downregulating receptor activator of nuclear factor Kappa-B ligand and cathepsin K and promoted osteogenesis, which was associated with the upregulation of OPG and downregulation of C/enhancer-binding protein alpha and proliferator-activated receptor gamma for adipogenic differentiation. Furthermore, it decreased the levels of tumorigenic genes such as Rac1, MMP9, and interleukin 1 beta. In summary, this study demonstrates that although a HFD aggravates bone metastases associated with breast cancer, mechanical loading significantly protected tumor-invaded bone by regulating the fate of bone marrow-derived cells. The current study suggests that mechanical loading can provide a noninvasive, palliative option for alleviating breast cancer-associated bone metastasis, in particular for obese patients."

However, it is unknown whether DR categorisation is predictive of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of DR categorisation in OSCC patients. Methods and results Data were collected from 118 patients with OSCC who underwent a curative oesophagectomy with T2 or deeper wall invasion. The DR in each tumour was classified as mature, intermediate or immature based on the presence or absence of keloid-like collagen and myxoid stroma. We identified 49 mature DR tumours, 41 intermediate DR tumours and 28 immature DR tumours. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was highest in the mature DR group (42.8%), followed by the intermediate DR group (25.0%) and the immature DR group (19.9%) (P = 0.022, log-rank test; P = 0.006, log-rank trend test). The 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rate was also highest in the mature DR group (48.5%), followed by the intermediate DR group (30.8%) and the immature DR group (26.8%) (P = 0.031, log-rank test; P = 0.010, log-rank trend test, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that an immature DR was an independent poor prognostic factor of OS and DSS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004).

An increasing amount of studies have focused on the functional interactions between CAFs and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We previously reported that G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) was highly expressed in prostate CAFs and plays a crucial role in prostate stromal cell activation. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of GPR30 expression in prostate CAFs affecting the interaction between CAFs and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) need further elucidation. Here, we found that, compared with CAF-shControl, CAF-shGPR30 inhibited macrophage migration through transwell migration assays, which should be attributed to the decreased expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). In addition, macrophages treated with a culture medium of CAF-shGPR30 exhibited attenuated M2 polarization with downregulated M2-like markers expression. Moreover, macrophages stimulated with a culture medium of CAF-shGPR30 were less efficient in promoting activation of fibroblast cells and invasion of PCa cells. Finally, cocultured CAF-shGPR30 and macrophages suppressed PCa cell invasion compared to cocultured CAF-shControl and macrophages by decreasing interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, and this effect could be abrogated with rescue expression of IL-6. Our results pinpoint the function of GPR30 in prostate CAFs on regulating the CAF-TAM interaction in the TME and provide new insights into PCa therapies via regulating TME."

However, little is known about the mechanism of action. Here, we studied the effects of purified fatty acid molecules on prostate tumor progression using the TRAMP-C2 syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model. Compared with omega-6 or omega-9-supplemented animals, we observed that late-stage prostate tumor growth was reduced with a monoacylglyceride (MAG)-conjugated form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation, whereas docosahexanenoic acid (DHA) caused an early reduction. MAG-EPA significantly decreased tumor blood vessel diameter (P < 0.001). RNA sequencing analysis revealed that MAG-EPA downregulated angiogenesis- and vascular-related pathways in tumors. We also observed this tissue vascular phenotype in a clinical trial testing MAG-EPA versus a high oleic sunflower oil placebo. Using anti-CD31 IHC, we observed that MAG-EPA reduced blood vessel diameter in prostate tumor tissue (P = 0.03) but not in normal adjacent tissue. Finally, testing autocrine and paracrine effects in an avascular tumor spheroid growth assay, both exogenous MAG-EPA and endogenous omega 3 reduced VEGF secretion and in vitro endothelial cell tube formation and blocked tumor spheroid growth, suggesting that omega 3 molecules can directly hinder prostate cancer cell growth. Altogether, our results suggest that fatty acids regulate prostate cancer growth and that a tumor-specific microenvironment is required for the anti-vascular effect of MAG-EPA in patients with prostate cancer."

The poor clinical prognosis and lack of successful treatments for metastatic breast cancer patients demand the development of new tumor-selective therapies. Thus, it is necessary to develop treatments capable of releasing therapeutic agents to both primary tumors and metastases that avoid toxic side effects in normal tissue, and neural stem cells are an attractive vehicle for tracking tumor cells and delivering anti-cancer agents. The authorspreviously demonstrated that a soluble form of growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) inhibits the growth of triple-negative breast tumors and glioblastoma. Methods: In this study, the authors engineered ReNcell CX (EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) neural progenitor cells to express truncated GAS1 (tGAS1) under a tetracycline/on inducible system using lentiviral vectors. Results: Here the authors show that treatment with ReNcell-tGAS1 in combination with tetracycline decreased primary tumor growth and inhibited the formation of metastases in tumor-bearing mice by diminishing the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in orthotopic mammary gland tumors. Moreover, the authors observed that ReNcell-tGAS1 prolonged the survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.

The hnRNP family proteins are important splicing factors that have been found to be associated with tumor progression. However, the influence of hnRNPs on cancer stem cells has not been extensively explored. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to examine gene expressions. RNA immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to identify the RNAs interacted with hnRNP A2B1. The in vivo assays were performed in nude mice. Results: In this study, the results showed that out of 19 evaluated hnRNPs, hnRNP A2B1 was significantly upregulated in melanoma stem cells compared with non-stem cells, suggesting an important role of hnRNP A2B1 in cancer stem cells. Silencing of hnRNP A2B1 triggered cell cycle arrest in G2 phase, leading to apoptosis of melanoma stem cells. The results also revealed that hnRNP A2B1 could bind to the precursor mRNAs of pro-apoptosis genes (DAPK1, SYT7, and RNF128) and anti-apoptosis genes (EIF3H, TPPP3, and DOCK2) to regulate the splicing of these 6 genes, thus promoting the expressions of anti-apoptosis genes and suppressing the expressions of pro-apoptosis genes. The in vivo data indicated that hnRNP A2B1 was required for tumorigenesis by affecting the splicing of TPPP3, DOCK2, EIF3H, RNF128, DAPK1, and SYT7, thus suppressing apoptosis of melanoma stem cells. Conclusion: Our findings showed the requirement of hnRNP A2B1 for tumorigenesis, thus presenting novel molecular insights into the role of hnRNPs in cancer stem cells."

However, capturing biological data with highly nonlinear and complex associations by most existing approaches for cancer diagnosis has been challenging. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection and second learning probability error ensemble model (named HFS-SLPEE) for precision cancer diagnosis. Specifically, we first integrated protein-coding gene expression profiles, non-coding RNA expression profiles, and DNA methylation data to provide rich information; afterward, we designed a novel hierarchical feature selection method, which takes the CpG-gene biological associations into account and can select a compact set of superior features; next, we used four individual classifiers with significant differences and apparent complementary to build the heterogeneous classifiers; lastly, we developed a second learning probability error ensemble model called SLPEE to thoroughly learn the new data consisting of classifiers-predicted class probability values and the actual label, further realizing the self-correction of the diagnosis errors. Benchmarking comparisons on TCGA showed that HFS-SLPEE performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we analyzed in-depth 10 groups of selected features and found several novel HFS-SLPEE-predicted epigenomics and epigenetics biomarkers for breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (e.g., TSLP and ADAMTS9-AS2), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (e.g., HBA1 and CTB-43E15.1), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (e.g., IRX2 and BMPR1B-AS1)."

Although circular RNAs (circRNAs) involve in regulating BLCA progression, the role of a novel circular RNA circSETD3 in regulating BLCA pathogenesis has not been studied. The expression of circSETD3, miR-641, PTEN mRNA in BLCA tissues and cell lines were measured using RT-qPCR. The gain-of-function experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo to detect the effects of circSETD3 on cell proliferation, migration, EMT, and stemness maintenance. Besides, rescue experiments were performed to demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of circSETD3/miR-641/PTEN in BLCA cell malignant phenotypes in vitro. CircSETD3 was remarkably downregulated in the cancerous clinical tissues and cell lines, in contrast with their normal counterparts, and circSETD3 tended to be deficient in BLCA patients with larger tumor size, advanced clinical stages, positive lymph metastasis and worse prognosis. In addition, circular isoforms of circSETD3 were more resistant to RNase R+ and actinomycetes D treatment compared to their linear isoforms, and circSETD3 mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of the BLCA cells. Further gain-of-function experiments showed that circSETD3 acted as a tumor suppressor to suppress BLCA cell proliferation, migration, EMT and stemness, and the underlying mechanisms had also been elucidated. Mechanistically, circSETD3 sponged miR-641 to upregulate PTEN, resulting in the blockage of BLCA progression. Our findings indicated that circSETD3 acted as a vital tumor suppressor in BLCA via regulating the miR-641/PTEN axis."

The transcriptional factor Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) regulates cell proliferation, tumor initiation, and progression in multiple cancer types. However, its biological function and clinical significance in SCLC remain unestablished. Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and SCLC datasets in the present study disclosed significant upregulation of FOXM1 mRNA in SCLC cell lines and tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that FOXM1 is positively correlated with pathways regulating cell proliferation and DNA damage repair, as evident from sensitization of FOXM1-depleted SCLC cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, Foxm1 knockout inhibited SCLC formation in the Rb1(fl/fl)Trp53(fl/fl)Myc(LSL/LSL) (RPM) mouse model associated with increased levels of neuroendocrine markers, Ascl1 and Cgrp, and decrease in Yap1. Consistently, FOXM1 depletion in NCI-H1688 SCLC cells reduced migration and enhanced apoptosis and sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide. SCLC with high FOXM1 expression (N = 30, 57.7%) was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage, extrathoracic metastases, and decrease in overall survival (OS), compared with the low-FOXM1 group (7.90 vs. 12.46 months). Moreover, the high-FOXM1 group showed shorter progression-free survival after standard chemotherapy, compared with the low-FOXM1 group (3.90 vs. 8.69 months). Our collective findings support the utility of FOXM1 as a prognostic biomarker and potential molecular target for SCLC."

The molecular events associated with mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)/tumor cell interactions should be studied to identify the role of MSCs on suppressing or inducing the key signaling pathways of tumor cells. Thus, designing therapeutic approaches is considered as important. In the present study, hAMSCs and MiaPaca2 cells were first cultured separately. In addition, both cell lines were co-cultured by using 0.4 mu m pore sized transwell membranes in different times. Further, the RNA of the cells was extracted, and Bcl2, Bar, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Src, C-terminal Src Kinase (CSK), and SGK223 expression were analyzed through quantitative real time PCR. Furthermore, the total cell lysates of the cells were prepared and analyzed by using western blot. Based on the results, the expression of EGFR, c-Src, SGK223, and CSK in MiaPaca2 cells reduced after treating with hAMSCs. Notably, the cellular apoptosis of MiaPaca2 cells was induced in 2D cell culture system. Further, the anti-cancer activity of conditioned medium from hAMSCs was confirmed in a 3D cell culture model by using hanging drop technique. Finally, hAMSCs have inhibitory effects on pancreatic cancer cells and can be considered as a therapeutic way to suppress EGFR, c-Src, and SGK223, as the potent targets in cancer cell signaling."

Various endeavor has been made to explore the molecular biology basis of TNBC. Herein, we reported a novel function of factor Kinectin 1 (KTN1) as a carcinogenic promoter in TNBC. KTN1 expression in TNBC was increased compared with adjacent tissues or luminal or Her2 subtypes of breast cancer, and TNBC patients with high KTN1 expression have poor prognosis. In functional studies, knockdown of KTN1 inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of TNBC both in vitro and in vivo, while overexpression of KTN1 promoted cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the interaction of cytokine-cytokine receptor, particularly CXCL8 gene, was upregulated by KTN1, which was supported by the further experiments. CXCL8 depletion inhibited the tumorigenesis and progression of TNBC. Additionally, rescue experiments validated that KTN1-mediated cell growth acceleration in TNBC was dependent on CXCL8 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it was found that KTN1 enhanced the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B/p65 protein at Ser536 site, and specifically bound to NF-kappa B/p65 protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Moreover, the transcription of CXCL8 gene was directly upregulated by the complex of KTN1 and NF-kappa B/p65 protein. Taken together, our results elucidated a novel mechanism of KTN1 gene in TNBC tumorigenesis and progression. KTN1 may be a potential molecular target for the development of TNBC treatment."

However, the impacts of CELF2 on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and clinical outcomes of tumours remain unclear. In this study, we found that elevated CELF2 expression was markedly correlated with prolonged survival in multiple tumours, particularly in breast and lung cancers. Notably, CELF2 only impacted the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with lymph node metastasis. Further investigation showed CELF2 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration abundance of dendritic cells (DCs), CD8+ T cells and neutrophils in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and DCs in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). CELF2 also had strong correlations with markers of diverse TIICs such as T cells, tumour-associated macrophages and DCs in BRCA and LUSC. Importantly, CELF2 was significantly associated with plenty of immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) and outperformed five prevalent biomarkers including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, CD8 and tumour mutation burden in predicting immunotherapeutic responses. Immunohistochemistry also revealed lower protein levels of CELF2 in TNBC and LUSC compared to normal tissues, and patients with high expression showed significantly prolonged prognosis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that increased CELF2 expression was closely related to better prognosis and superior TIIC infiltration and ICM expression, particularly in BRCA and LUSC. CELF2 also performed well in evaluating the immunotherapeutic efficacy, suggesting CELF2 might be a promising biomarker."

We demonstrated that ZEB2, the transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was upregulated in ascites cells from HGSOC patients and in CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB2 in EOC cells decreased the percentage of CSLCs and reduced the colony forming potential, cell invasion capacity and expression of pluripotent genes Oct4 and Nanog. Inhibition of ZEB2 also induced cellular apoptosis and impacted the tumorigenicity of ovarian CSLCs. The mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin were downregulated, while the epithelial marker E-cadherin was upregulated after ZEB2 knockdown. MiR-200a, a molecule that downregulates ZEB2, had the opposite effect of ZEB2 expression in EOC-CSLCs. A retrospective study of 98 HGSOC patients on the relationship of ascites volume, pelvic and abdominal metastasis, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and the malignant involvement of abdominal organs and lymph nodes was performed. Patients with high expression of ZEB2 in tumour tissues had a higher metastasis rate and a poorer prognosis than those with low expression. The parameters of ZEB2 expression and ascites volume were strongly linked with the prognostic outcome of HGSOC patients and had higher hazard ratios. These findings illustrated that ZEB2 facilitates the invasive metastasis of EOC-CSLCs and can predict peritoneal metastasis and a poor prognosis in HGSOC patients."

Cell viability was determined via MTT (colorimetric) and colony-forming assays, and the rate of apoptosis was determined using propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V double-staining. The expressions of proteins were determined by Western blotting. For our in-vivo studies, a murine xenograft model was established to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of the combination of autophagy inhibitor and DDP. The results showed that treatment with DDP increased the expressions of ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 1 (ABCC1), and P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) in the HNE1/DDP cell lines. Treatment with chloroquine decreased the expression levels of ABCB1, ABCC1, and P-gp, and increased the formation of LC3-II and the expression levels of p62 in the HNE1/DDP cells. Additionally, the combination of autophagy inhibitors and DDP produced a synergistic effect on DDP-induced cell death and apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination of the autophagy inhibitor and DDP showed significant anti-tumor effects in the xenograft mouse model. In summary, autophagy inhibitors show synergistic anti-tumor effects with DDP in vitro against DDP-resistant nasopharyngeal cancer cells and in vivo in our xenograft murine model."

We previously showed that in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant colorectal cancer cells, the transcriptional coactivator YAP is differentially regulated at critical transitions connected with reversible quiescence/dormancy to promote metastasis. Here, we found that experimental YAP activation in 5-FU-sensitive and 5-FU-resistant HT29 colorectal cancer cells enhanced nuclear YAP localization and the transcript levels of the retinoic acid (RA) receptors RAR alpha/gamma and RAR target genes CYP26A1, ALDH1A3, and LGR5 through RA Response Elements (RARE). In these two cell models, constitutive YAP activation reinforced the expression of the sternness biomarkers and regulators ALDH1A3, LGR5, and OCT4. Conversely, YAP silencing, RAR/RXR inhibition by the pan-RAR antagonist BMS493, and vitamin A depletion downregulatcd sternness traits and self-renewal. Regarding the mechanisms engaged, proximity-dependent labeling, nuclear YAP pulldown coupled with mass spectrometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)/re-ChIP experiments revealed: (i) the nuclear colocalization/interaction of YAP with RAR gamma and RXRs; and (ii) combined genomic cooccupancy of YAP, RAR alpha/gamma, and RXR alpha interactomes at proximal RAREs of LGR5 and ALDHIA3 promoters. Moreover, activation of the YAP/RAR-RXR cross-talk in colorectal cancer cells promoted RAR self-activation loops via vitamin A metabolism, RA, and active RAR ligands generated by ALDH1A3. Together, our data identify YAP as a bona fide RAR-RXR transcriptional coactivator that acts through RARE-activated sternness genes."

Surgery remains the primary curative option for localized cancers, but good prognoses require complete removal of primary tumors and timely recognition of metastases. To expand surgical capabilities and enhance patient outcomes, we developed a six-channel color/near-infrared image sensor inspired by the mantis shrimp visual system that enabled near-infrared fluorescence image guidance during surgery. The mantis shrimp's unique eye, which maximizes the number of photons contributing to and the amount of information contained in each glimpse of its surroundings, is recapitulated in our single-chip imaging system that integrates arrays of vertically stacked silicon photodetectors and pixelated spectral filters. To provide information about tumor location unavailable from a single instrument, we tuned three color channels to permit an intuitive perspective of the surgical procedure and three near-infrared channels to permit multifunctional imaging of optical probes highlighting cancerous tissue. In nude athymic mice bearing human prostate tumors, our image sensor enabled simultaneous detection of two tumor-targeted fluorophores, distinguishing diseased from healthy tissue in an estimated 92% of cases. It also permitted extraction of near-infrared structured illumination enabling the mapping of the three-dimensional topography of tumors and surgical sites to within 1.2-mm error.

It is associated with poor outcomes, and its etiology and pathogenesis are not fully understood. There is great hope for immunotherapy in treating many malignant tumors; therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the use of immunotherapy for BLCA. Methods: Gene expression profiles and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and immune-related genes (IRGs) were downloaded from the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal. Differentially-expressed and survival-associated IRGs in patients with BLCA were identified using computational algorithms and Cox regression analysis. We also performed functional enrichment analysis. Based on IRGs, we employed multivariate Cox analysis to develop a new prognostic index. Results: We identified 261 IRGs that were differentially expressed between BLCA tissue and adjacent tissue, 30 of which were significantly associated with the overall survival (all P<0.01). According to multivariate Cox analysis, nine survival-related IRGs (MMP9, PDGFRA, AHNAK, OAS1, OLR1, RAC3, IGF1, PGF, and SH3BP2) were high-risk genes. We developed a prognostic index based on these IRGs and found it accurately predicted BLCA outcomes associated with the TNM stage. Intriguingly, the IRG-based prognostic index reflected infiltration of macrophages. Conclusions: An independent IRG-based prognostic index provides a practical approach for assessing patients' immune status and prognosis with BLCA. This index independently predicted outcomes of BLCA."

Their receptor is the Na+,K+ ATPase, but other plasma membrane proteins might bind CGs as well. Herein, we evaluated the short- and long-lasting cytotoxic effects of the natural cardenolide glucoevatromonoside (GEV) on non-small-cell lung cancer H460 cells. We also tested GEV effects on Na+,K+ -ATPase activity and membrane currents, alone or in combination with selected chemotherapy drugs. GEV reduced viability, migration, and invasion of H460 cells spheroids. It also induced cell cycle arrest and death and reduced the clonogenic survival and cumulative population doubling. GEV inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity on A549 and H460 cells and purified pig kidney cells membrane. However, it showed no activity on the human red blood cell plasma membrane. Additionally, GEV triggered a Cl-mediated conductance on H460 cells without affecting the transient voltage-gated sodium current. The administration of GEV in combination with the chemotherapeutic drugs paclitaxel (PAC), cisplatin (CIS), irinotecan (IRI), and etoposide (ETO) showed synergistic antiproliferative effects, especially when combined with GEV + CIS and GEV + PAC. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GEV is a potential drug for cancer therapy because it reduces lung cancer H460 cell viability, migration, and invasion. Our results also reveal a link between the Na+,K+-ATPase and Cl- ion channels. [GRAPHICS] ."

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms. Here, we proved that propofol regulated miR-340/CDK2 axis to suppress bladder cancer progression in vitro. Methods: MicroRNA (MiR)-340 expression in 5637 cells was examined using qRT-PCR. Cyclin-dependent kinase2 (CDK2) expression was detected using both qRT-PCR and western blot. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins and cell cycle-related proteins were evaluated using western blot. CCK-8 assay and BrdU assay were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Moreover, flow cytometry assay was employed to assess cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Finally, dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to verify the binding relationship between miR-340 and CDK2. Results: Here we showed that propofol treatment inhibited cell proliferation of 5637 cells but enhanced cell apoptosis. Propofol upregulated miR-340 in a dose and time dependent manner. MiR-340 inhibitor could reverse the effect of propofol on the proliferation and apoptosis of 5637 cells. Next, dual luciferase reporter assay displayed that miR-340 directly bound to the 3'-UTR of CDK2. Finally, inhibition of CDK2 could partly reversed the effect of miR-340 inhibitor on cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of propofol-treated 5637 cells. Conclusion: In total, our results proved that targeting miR340/CDK2 axis was novel to enhance the anti-tumor effects of propofol in bladder cancer in vitro, and our study provided alternative therapeutic strategies for clinical treatment of bladder cancer."

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mode that is characterized by intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We constructed a prognostic multigene signature based on ferroptosis-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Moreover, we comprehensively analyzed the role of ferroptosis-associated miRNAs, lncRNAs, and immune responses. A total of 259 ferroptosis-related genes were extracted. KEGG function analysis of these genes revealed that they were mainly enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, central carbon metabolism in cancer, and PPAR signaling pathway. Fifteen differentially expressed genes (ALOX15, ALOX15B, ANO6, BRD4, CISD1, DRD5, FLT3, G6PD, IFNG, NGB, NOS2, PROM2, SLC1A4, SLC38A1, and TP63) were selected as independent prognostic factors for BC patients. Moreover, T cell functions, including the CCR score, immune checkpoint, cytolytic activity, HLA, inflammation promotion, para-inflammation, T cell co-stimulation, T cell co-inhibition, and type II INF responses were significantly different between the low-risk and high-risk groups of the TCGA cohort. Immune checkpoints between the two groups revealed that the expressions of PDCD-1 (PD-1), CTLA4, LAG3, TNFSF4/14, TNFRSF4/8/9/14/18/25, and IDO1/2 among others were significantly different. A total of 1185 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs and 219 ferroptosis-related miRNAs were also included in this study.

The involvement of such non-protein-coding RNAs in nuclear organization and chromatin remodeling is often associated with an increased risk of human malignancies. In cancer, lncRNAs either promote cell survival or may act as a growth suppressor, thus conferring a key regulatory function other than their established role in fundamental cellular processes. Interestingly, lncRNAs interfere with the stages of apoptosis and related pathways involving p53. Many of these molecules either regulate or are regulated by p53 while mounting oncogenic events. Consequently, they may confer both prosurvival or proapoptotic functions depending upon the tissue type. Since the mechanism of cell death is bypassed in many human cancers, it has emerged that the lncRNAs are either overexpressed or knocked down to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. Nonetheless, the abundant expression of lncRNAs in tumor cells renders them suitable targets for anticancer therapies. Although the role of lncRNAs in the p53 network and apoptosis has been independently defined, their interplay in activating p53-target genes during cell cycle arrest remains unexplored. Thus, we have specifically reviewed the possible involvement of lncRNAs in the p53-mediated apoptosis of human cancer cells. In particular, we summarize the growing evidence from individual studies and analyze whether lncRNAs are essential to facilitate apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. This may lead to the identification of p53-associated lncRNAs that are suitable therapeutic targets or diagnostic/prognostic markers."

Public gene expression microarray data from online database and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that CSNK2B was highly expressed in CRC tissues than in normal tissues. In vitro and in vivo cellular functional experiments showed that increased CSNK2B expression promoted CRC cell viability and tumorigenesis of CRC. Further western blots and rescue experiments confirmed that CSNK2B promoted CRC cell proliferation mainly by activating the mTOR signaling pathway.

TCR-engineered T cells targeting E7 for patients with metastatic HPV-associated epithelial cancers	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article								"In a first-in-human phase 1 trial of patients with HPV-associated metastatic epithelial cancers, T cells targeting HPV-16 E7 were well tolerated, with one observed dose-limiting toxicity, and elicited objective clinical responses in 6 of 12 treated patients. Genetically engineered T cell therapy can induce remarkable tumor responses in hematologic malignancies. However, it is not known if this type of therapy can be applied effectively to epithelial cancers, which account for 80-90% of human malignancies. We have conducted a first-in-human, phase 1 clinical trial of T cells engineered with a T cell receptor targeting HPV-16 E7 for the treatment of metastatic human papilloma virus-associated epithelial cancers (NCT02858310). The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose. Cell dose was not limited by toxicity with a maximum dose of 1 x 10(11) engineered T cells administered. Tumor responses following treatment were evaluated using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) guidelines. Robust tumor regression was observed with objective clinical responses in 6 of 12 patients, including 4 of 8 patients with anti-PD-1 refractory disease. Responses included extensive regression of bulky tumors and complete regression of most tumors in some patients. Genomic studies, which included intra-patient tumors with dichotomous treatment responses, revealed resistance mechanisms from defects in critical components of the antigen presentation and interferon response pathways. These findings demonstrate that engineered T cells can mediate regression of common carcinomas, and they reveal immune editing as a constraint on the curative potential of cellular therapy and possibly other immunotherapies in advanced epithelial cancer."

The depletion of oxygen in proliferating and advanced tumors causes an array of genetic, transcriptional, and metabolic adaptations that promote survival, metastasis, and a clinically malignant phenotype. At the nexus of these interconnected pathways are hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) which orchestrate transcriptional responses under hypoxia. The following review summarizes current literature regarding effects of hypoxia on DNA repair, metastasis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the cancer stem cell phenotype, and therapy resistance. We also discuss mechanisms and pathways, such as HIF signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, exosomes, and the unfolded protein response, that contribute to hypoxia-induced phenotypic changes. Finally, novel therapeutics that target the hypoxic tumor microenvironment or interfere with hypoxia-induced pathways are reviewed."

Through RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches, we identified TNS3 as the potential target gene for MLL3. MLL3 depletion caused downregulation of H3K4mel and H3K27ac on an enhancer similar to 7 kb ahead of TNS3. 3C assay indicated the identified enhancer interacts with TNS3 promoter and repression of enhancer activity by dCas9-KRAB system impaired TNS3 expression. Exogenous expression of TNS3 in MLL3 deficient cells completely blocked the enhanced cell migration phenotype.

The present study aimed to investigate Siglec-15 expression in gastric cancer (GC) patient tissues and to evaluate its clinical value. Siglec-15 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 71 patients. Siglec-15 staining was observed in tumor cells of 53 (74.64%) patients, with significant association with histologic classification and angiolymphatic invasion (p<0.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis also detected Siglec-15 in tumor-associated stroma cells (macrophages/myeloid cells). There was no significant association with outcome parameters. Siglec-15 expression in well differentiated histological GC tissues and in the tumor microenvironment are potential targets to be further investigated as a novel prognostic factor for GC."

However, the role of HMGA1 in the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that HMGA1 is overexpressed in GC cells and the high expression of HMGA1 was correlated with worse survival in GC patients using a bioinformatics assay. Functionally, HMGA1 affected the EdU incorporation, colony formation, migration and invasion of GC cells by exogenously increasing or decreasing the expression of HMGA1. Mechanistically, HMGA1 directly bound to the SUZ12 and CCDC43 promoter and transactivated its expression in GC cells. Inhibition of SUZ12 and CCDC43 attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of HMGA1-overexpressing GC cells in vitro. Moreover, both HMGA1 and SUZ12/CCDC43 were highly expressed in cancer cells but not in normal gastric tissues, and their expressions were positively correlated. Finally, a tail vein metastatic assay showed that HMGA1 promoted SUZ12/CCDC43-mediated GC cell metastasis in vivo. Our findings suggest that HMGA1 promotes GC growth and metastasis by transactivating SUZ12 and CCDC43 expression, highlighting HMGA1 as a potential prognostic biomarker in the treatment of GC."

However, prognosis is poor for patients with metastasized disease. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, yet in situ and localized, thin melanomas can be hiopsied with little to no postsurgical follow-up. However, patients with metastatic melanoma require significant clinical involvement and have a 5-year survival of only 34% to 52%, largely dependent on the site of colonization. Melanoma metastasis is a multi-step process requiring dynamic changes in cell surface proteins regulating adhesiveness to the extracellular matrix (ECM), stroma, and other cancer cells in varied tumor microenvironments.

Autophagy is critical for cysteine metabolism in pancreatic cancer through regulation of SLC7A11	AUTOPHAGY			English	Article						Autophagy; cysteine; lysosome; metabolism; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma		"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The elevated macroautophagy/autophagy in these tumors supports growth, promotes immune evasion, and increases therapeutic resistance. Therefore, targeting autophagy is a therapeutic strategy that is being pursued to treat PDAC patients. Whereas autophagy inhibition impairs mitochondrial metabolism in PDAC, the specific metabolite(s) that becomes limiting when autophagy is inhibited has not been identified. We report that loss of autophagy specifically results in intracellular cysteine depletion under nutrient-replete conditions. Mechanistically, we show that PDAC cells utilize the autophagy machinery to regulate the activity and localization of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 at the plasma membrane. Upon inhibition of autophagy, SLC7A11 is localized to lysosomes in an MTORC2-dependent manner. Our findings reveal a novel connection between autophagy and cysteine metabolism in pancreatic cancer."

The invasion, survival, colonization, and stimulation of further inflammation within the gastric mucosa are possible due to several evasive mechanisms induced by the virulence factors that are expressed by the bacterium.

ZMP-treated B16 cells failed to follow chemotactic gradients across rigid confinements and could not generate stable sub-endothelial pseudopodia under endothelial monolayers. In vivo, ZMP-treated Beta 16 cells failed to extravasate though lung capillaries.

Here we draw key evidences from the literature on K-Ras-driven cellular transformation in the context of apoptosis to shed light on the key players that are required for cellular transformation and explain how aiming p53 could be useful to target cellular transformation. The defects in key apoptosis regulators such as p53, Bax, and Bak lead to apoptosis evasion, cellular transformation, and genomic instability to further lead to stemness, tumorigenesis, and metastasis via c-Myc-dependent transcription. Therefore enabling key apoptotic checkpoints in combination with K-Ras inhibitors will be a promising therapeutic target in cancer therapy."

However, it still remains largely unknown about how EML4-ALK fusion exactly fires downstream signaling and drives lung cancer formation. We here find that EML4-ALK variant 1 (exon 1-13 of EML4 fused to exon 20-29 of ALK) forms condensates via phase separation in the cytoplasm of various human cancer cell lines. Using two genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), we find that EML4-ALK variant 1 can drive lung tumorigenesis and these murine tumors, as well as primary tumor-derived organoids, clearly show the condensates of EML4-ALK protein, further supporting the findings from in vitro study. Mutation of multiple aromatic residues in EML4 region significantly impairs the phase separation of EML4-ALK and dampens the activation of the downstream signaling pathways, especially the STAT3 phosphorylation. Importantly, it also significantly decreases cancer malignant transformation and tumor formation. These data together highlight an important role of phase separation in orchestrating EML4-ALK signaling and promoting tumorigenesis, which might provide new clues for the development of clinical therapeutic strategies in treating lung cancer patients with the EML4-ALK fusion."

Using two-independent cohorts, we found the common frequently mutated genes TTN and OBSCN had the significant correlation with higher tumour mutation burden (TMB) and favourable overall survival. TTN and OBSCN also displayed significant commutation phenomenon. Therefore, based on the status of TTN and OBSCN, we stratified patients into 'Double-WT' phenotype, 'Single-Hit' phenotype and 'Double-Hit' phenotype. Importantly, the 'Double-Hit' phenotype had favourable prognosis, low malignant events propensity, and highest TMB, immune cells infiltration abundance, POLE mutation rate, microsatellite instability ratio, as well as immune checkpoints expression compared with the other two phenotypes. These results indicated that the 'Double-Hit' phenotype suggested 'immune-hot' tumours and potentially better immunotherapeutic efficacy. Bioinformatic algorithm assessment of immunotherapy responses also confirmed this conclusion, and the 'Double-Hit' phenotype was found to be a better predictor of immunotherapy than PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, TMB and microsatellite status. This study revealed CRC patients with TTN/OBSCN 'Double-Hit' was significantly associated favourable prognosis, 'immune-hot' subtype and potentially better immunotherapeutic efficacy."

Bone marrow is an important secondary lymphoid organ with a unique immune contexture. Even at non-disease state immune cells and bone cells interact with each other, bone cells supporting the development of immune cells and immune cells regulating bone turnover. In cancer, tumor cells interfere with this homeostatic process starting from formation of pre-metastatic niche and later supporting growth of bone metastases. In this review, we introduce a novel concept osteoimmuno-oncology (OIO), which refers to interactions between bone, immune and tumor cells in bone metastatic microenvironment. We also discuss therapeutic opportunities of targeting immune cells in bone metastases, and associated efficacy and safety concerns."

The presence of CSCs is a key factor leading to tumor progression and metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles released by different kinds of cells and have the capacity to deliver certain cargoes, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, which have been recognized as a vital mediator in cell-to-cell communication. Recently, more and more studies have reported that EVs shed by CSCs make a significant contribution to tumor progression. CSCs-derived EVs are involved in tumor resistance, metastasis, angiogenesis, as well as the maintenance of stemness phenotype and tumor immunosuppression microenvironment. Here, we summarized the molecular mechanism by which CSCs-derived EVs in tumor progression. We believed that the fully understanding of the roles of CSCs-derived EVs in tumor development will definitely provide new ideas for CSCs-based therapeutic strategies."
